nick clegg tonight vowed to block the tories imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future coalition deal . in an interview on the bbc , mr clegg also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the tories agreed new taxes on the rich . in exactly the same way that i could never countenance recommending to the liberal democrats entering into a coalition with the labour party that isn’t serious about balancing the books rather than the specious stuff they’ve come up with today . ' they’re asking for £12billion over two years .
