( cnn ) if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration 's clean power plan is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy . surely president barack obama 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the united states ' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets . despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free , the obama administration 's energy policy plan is biased against it .
