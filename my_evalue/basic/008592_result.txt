the picture-perfect photo shoot is the handiwork of john daniels , 61 , from dunsfold in surrey , who has decades of experience working with animals . john said : ' i use the studio because i ca n't rely on the british weather , i 've had to cancel shoots in the past , so using the studio and building a set means its one less thing to worry about . ' i 've found that the older the animal is the harder it is to get it to sit with another , when they are very young they do n't really know whats going on , and a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy .
