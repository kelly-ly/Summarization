arsenal moved further clear of the two manchester clubs in second place , and kept the pressure up on leaders chelsea , as they held on to beat a spirited burnley at turf moor . arsene wenger 's side were far from their best , but aaron ramsey 's early goal put them ahead and burnley , for all their endeavour , did n't create too many clear-cut chances . tom heaton : saved well from ozil in the build-up to arsenalâ€™s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear .
