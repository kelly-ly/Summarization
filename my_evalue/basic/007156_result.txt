a saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from lance hohaia and james roby sent the supporting tommy makinson skipping through . and saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from jordan turner sent louie mccarthy-scarsbrook powering over the whitewash , with makinson adding the goal . hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former saint leon pryce made a telling intervention , attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle .
