the future of andy murray’s coaching arrangement with amelie mauresmo looks shrouded in doubt after he confirmed that they will take a prolonged break from each other after wimbledon . the 27-year-old scot , who is in munich for this week’s bmw open and joined in the 100-year celebrations at the iphitos tennis club on monday night , parted company with ivan lendl last year because the czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling . murray ( left ) arrives at the party alongside german sports manager michael mronz . right now amelie does all the major competitions but if she doesn’t want to do loads of time , i don’t find it beneficial if someone just comes in for the major competitions and doesn’t do any of the training , any of the other events , ’ murray said .
