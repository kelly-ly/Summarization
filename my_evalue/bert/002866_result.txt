who can resist bodenâ€™s bright knits and floral prints ? with its a-line sixties silhouette and alarmingly thigh-skimming length , this is the sort of frock that might be found in topshop . oooh , this silk shirt and full skirt combination looks like the sort of outfit i remember my mum wearing in the eighties . the blouse is very similar to those made by chic french brand equipment , even down to the breast pocket detail .
