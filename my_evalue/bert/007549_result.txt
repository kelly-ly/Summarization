wisden , the cricket bible , has launched a stinging attack on english cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game 's public . starting with the drubbing in australia , england lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014 , to say nothing of their defeat by the netherlands at the world twenty20 . the wisden editor is just as scathing about england 's decision to sack alastair cook as one-day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous world cup in england 's history . booth is a progressive , brilliant , imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as wisden .
