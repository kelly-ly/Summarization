an offensive attempt by a men 's magazine to commemorate fallen anzac soldiers has backfired as social media users and the department of veteran affairs condemn the crude ' commemorative issue ' . the issue , released on the monday leading up to the anzac weekend , included a 10-page feature with a list of '100 things every aussie should know about gallipoli ' and an interview with cover girl erin pash who revealed what features she admired in our service men . back in 2006 , nikki webster was featured wearing skimpy shorts and an army helmet , looking seductively over her shoulder , with the tag line reading ' for the boys ' . zoo 's distasteful campaign comes as supermarket giant , woolworths , found themselves being accused of trying to cash in on anzac day .
