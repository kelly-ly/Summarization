daniel ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for red bull to forge a return to the front of the grid . second best to mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs , red bull have struggled at the start of this year . in malaysia we had brake issues , a lot of overheating , so we have reverted back on a few things , even from last year which we knew was more efficient . ' just because it 's from last year it does n't mean it 's not better , so i guess we have taken a step back in that direction .
