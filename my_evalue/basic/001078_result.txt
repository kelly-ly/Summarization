( cnn ) u.s. president barack obama 's recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the middle east is far from reassuring to the region . for example , the president asserted in the interview that `` the u.s. 's core interests in the region are not oil , are not territorial ... our core interests are that everybody is living in peace , that it is orderly , that our allies are not being attacked , that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them , that massive displacements are n't taking place . '' yet , at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment , u.s. allies , such as the arab gulf states , jordan , lebanon and the legitimate government in yemen , found themselves under serious threat and attack ; the syrian regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens ; and the middle east was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history .
