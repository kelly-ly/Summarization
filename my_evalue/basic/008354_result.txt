matej vydra 's superb volley helped keep watford on the trail for automatic promotion as they recorded a 2-0 victory over a spirited millwall side , who sank further into relegation trouble . millwall were on top for much of the first half but a stunning hit from vydra saw the hornets take in a slender advantage at half-time . aiden o'brien was a constant menace for the hosts - who had an early penalty shout turned down - but watford were far too clinical , as adlene guedioura slotted a vital second goal shortly after the break .
