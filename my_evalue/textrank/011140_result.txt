mr davis brought up the subject of mr balls ' comment four years ago that it was ' fantasy ' to think britain would get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector . when mr davis said he wanted to ' focus on the number of jobs ' , mr miliband had to admit : ' the number of jobs has gone up , but you know , i 'm going to let people in this election make the judgment about whether that means the economy 's fixed or not . ' mr davis interjected : ' it 's gone up by two million , has n't it ? it is n't good enough for me that you 're 12 times more likely to get to university from an advantaged compared to a disadvantaged background . ' mr davis asked : ' so on issues about jobs , crime , social mobility , comments , predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong .
