baylee almon should be gearing up for her first legal drink on saturday . other grieving families felt aren almon and the firefighter , chris fields , stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion after the photograph received so much attention ( pictured : the memorial ) . ' i know after the bombing the other families didn’t like me , and i’m not looking forward to that . ' to me , basically , i try to see that picture as something which represents everybody who died in that bombing .
