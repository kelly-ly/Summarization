( aurum press £12.99 ) waiting nervously at the starting line of her first 155 km race around mont blanc , 29-year-old lizzy hawker looked down at her holey long johns , clumpy trail shoes and the poorly fitting rucksack she had borrowed , then up at the elite lycra kit of her fellow competitors . lizzy hawker entered the 2005 ultra-trail du mont-blanc ( pictured ) on a whim and she 's since gone on to become britain’s most distinctive female ‘ ultra runner’ .
