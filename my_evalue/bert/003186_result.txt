watching the first male skier to ever clinch four straight world cup titles fly through snowcapped slopes is impressive enough . the process involved 11 cameras , a specially-enhanced slope , and three days to set up before creating the incredible video in one take with the 26-year-old austrian . the team picked vibrant colours which would contrast heavily with the crisp white snow . one chance !
