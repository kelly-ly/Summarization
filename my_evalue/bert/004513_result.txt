will stevens is hoping for third time lucky this weekend in his bid to finally compete in a grand prix weekend with manor . manor have naturally had their teething problems since being rescued from administration , notably in melbourne where stevens and team-mate roberto merhi failed to make it out on track for a single lap due to the rebuild of their it infrastructure . but i understand everything that has gone on . coming here we 're in a much better position again and i 'd like to think i 'll be racing .
