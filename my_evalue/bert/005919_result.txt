the boat that sank in the mediterranean killing 400 migrants capsized when desperate passengers surged to one side because they thought they were about to be rescued , it emerged yesterday . the commercial ship was unaware of the unfolding disaster and went on its journey , leaving men , women and children in the water before an italian naval vessel arrived at the site some 80 miles south of the island of lampedusa . the death toll is the largest in the region since october 2013 and came as 42 boats , coming mainly from libya and north africa and carrying 5,110 migrants – including 317 unaccompanied children – were rescued in just 48 hours trying to make the hazardous crossing to europe . many who make it have told horrific stories of their barbaric exploitation by people smugglers , who they accuse of rape , murder and torture .
