the low-key video she released on sunday announcing her run for the white house is filled with women -- young , old , black , white , asian and latina -- working in their gardens , taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world . clinton , who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007 , is barely in the video at all , appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others . the challenge for clinton in breaking the `` highest , hardest glass ceiling '' that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters , while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history .
