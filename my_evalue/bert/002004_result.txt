measuring 30cm high and made entirely from cake , these amazing hand-crafted designs are a luxury alternative to traditional easter eggs . the eggs were created as part of a feature for cake masters magazine - and feature in this month 's edition , with easter just around the corner . laura loukaides , from laura loukaides cakes , said : ' my egg is inspired by one of my favourite faberg√© designs - the 1914 mosaic egg created for nicholas ii of russia . i love how black diamonds look in fine jewellery so i wanted to replicate the style by creating a diamond encrusted egg using individually placed sugar pearls .
