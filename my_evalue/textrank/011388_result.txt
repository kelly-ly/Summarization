sentenced : rebecca calder , 24 , who was jailed for a year today , went out drinking on the same night she used her victims ' bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash , pictured left and right . the thefts came to light when the couple 's two daughters became concerned when she noticed on her parent 's bank statements that large amounts of cash , in £100 , £200 and £300 amounts , were being withdrawn from cashpoints almost every other day . i hope this case serves as a stark warning to anyone who is put in a position of trust , like calder was , to look after elderly and vulnerable people . ' temptation will clearly be there but do you really want to be known as someone who stole from elderly people ?
