ed miliband ( pictured yesterday at the shree swaminarayan temple , north london ) is pressing on with his controversial cap rents , despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire . rent controls have already proved a disaster in britain after they were introduced in the first world war . alan ward , of the residential landlords association , warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past , adding they ‘ would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market’ . david cox , of the association of residential letting agents , said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because ‘ landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance’ .
