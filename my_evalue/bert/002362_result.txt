barcelona threw away a two-goal lead against sevilla thanks to individual errors by claudio bravo and gerard pique , which leaves them just two points ahead of real madrid at the top of la liga . that wasn’t the case here . and it was sevilla he hit a hat-trick against at the camp nou earlier this season , the game where he overtook telmo zarra’s all-time record of 251 goals . this could be the last time he plays against sevilla , his former side , and he evoked memories of his former self , charging up the right but getting back when needed as well .
