since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery . i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill . using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration .
