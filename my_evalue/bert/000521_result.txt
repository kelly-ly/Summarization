( cnn ) it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the islamic state of iraq and syria . there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of isis is made up not by a group of islamic zealots , but rather high-ranking officers from saddam hussein 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular . in this respect , isis is like other radical islamic groups , such as the taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds . but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their arab enemies , on building a caliphate in iraq and syria .
