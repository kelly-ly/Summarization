the first signs of dark matter interacting with a force other than gravity may have been found . so the 85 per cent figure above relates only to the fraction of ' matter ' that is dark . if the particles collide with each other , the friction from the collisions would cause the dark matter to slow down , and fall behind the galaxy . we know that dark matter exists because of the way that it interacts gravitationally , helping to shape the universe , but we still know embarrassingly little about what dark matter actually is , ' said team member dr liliya williams of the university of minnesota .
