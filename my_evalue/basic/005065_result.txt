it is eight long , barren years since an english club claimed the top prize in european rugby and the bookmakers are n't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year . when wasps claimed the heineken cup in 2007 with victory over leicester , it seemed unthinkable that the premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long . northampton , saracens , bath and wasps are well-funded , with strong squads , but their resources are modest compared to french powerhouses toulon , clermont and racing , who have budgets three or four times the size of their premiership opponents .
