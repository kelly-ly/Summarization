sergio garcia insists he is focused on winning his first pga tour title since 2012 at this week 's shell houston open , despite the masters being just around the corner . the 35-year-old , who finished third 12 months ago but went on to miss the cut at augusta , told a pre-tournament press conference : ' i think that every single week it 's a new story and some weeks you play terrible and then the next week you play amazing . ' i think that there 's no doubt that obviously the masters is in the back of our minds , but i 'm here to play well , to get in some good rhythm , to have a chance at winning this week and then as soon as sunday finishes then i 'll concentrate on the masters .
