nathan hughes on friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out george north sensationally over-turned on appeal , following an outcry on his behalf . the wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion , as he scored a try for northampton on march 27 . north was left out cold on the pitch at franklin 's gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . it was the third time that the wales and lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months .
