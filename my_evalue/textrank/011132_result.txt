scientists believe that streams of asteroid fragments can travel on nearly identical orbits . tidal forces may disperse the debris over time and asteroids can also break up due to the pull of large planets . ' the tidal effect on an asteroid , which rapidly rotates under the gravitational field of a planet , can fragment these objects or release large rocks from its surface , ' said trigo . ' the researchers hope their latest study will help shed light on how asteroid create projectiles , and which ones pose a threat to earth . knowing where the meteorite originates could also help them us better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system .
