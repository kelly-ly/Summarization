red squirrels have returned to one of britain 's most stunning beauty spots after a 16-year absence . native reds have been almost wiped out in the country , except for a few pockets in the north of england , the isle of wight and scotland after rival grey squirrels arrived from america in the 19th century . more than 700 red squirrels are now thought to live on anglesey , with many crossing the menai strait to settle in bangor .
