this is the dramatic moment a fireman risked his own life to grab the arm of a woman who was attempting to throw herself off the ledge of a 10-storey chinese tower block . she was then pushed kicking and screaming back in through the window by the firemen before being restrained by police officers and taken to hospital . she was eventually bundled back through the window kicking and screaming by the firemen . as the ledge is narrow and difficult for me to get good leverage i had to flatten myself out and wait for my colleagues to help .
