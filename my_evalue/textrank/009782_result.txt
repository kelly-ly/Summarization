this incredible image was captured above pitcaple in aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer graeme whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the lyrid meteor shower . the strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour , but in 1982 americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour . while the lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour , most years the peak , which occurs tonight , only produces between five and 20 per hour ( the lyrid shower pictured from space ) .
