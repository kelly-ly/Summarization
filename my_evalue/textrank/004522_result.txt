the terrorist group al qaida seized control of a major airport , sea port and oil terminal in southern yemen today , consolidating its hold on the country 's largest province . military officials and residents said al qaida fighters clashed briefly with members of one of yemen 's largest brigades outside mukalla , a city the militants overran earlier this month and where they freed prison inmates . the rebels are staunch opponents of al qaida but are currently locked in fierce battles with forces loyal to yemen 's internationally recognised president abed rabbo mansour hadi , who fled to saudi arabia last month .
