bath abbey could be linked to the city 's roman water network to heat the vast medieval church using ancient underground springs . each day , a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the roman baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site . the plans for bath abbey 's underfloor heating may use modern technologies , but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the romans . the modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation .
