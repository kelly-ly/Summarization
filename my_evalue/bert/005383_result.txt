veteran burnley defender michael duff believes manager sean dyche could one day take charge of england . i 've learned a lot from him , little things he does , and i think he will go on to be a top manager . ' the pro licence is nearly all based on management , so you look at sessions differently , look at the manager 's presentations - and this one is n't a bad manager to learn from . ' dyche has improved burnley 's fortunes since he took over at turf moor in october 2012 .
