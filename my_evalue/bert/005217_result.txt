there was uproar on the south coast when nicola cortese sacked local hero nigel adkins and replaced him with the relatively unknown argentine , on english shores at least , mauricio pochettino . in pochettino’s role as ‘ head coach’ as opposed to all-round manager he has more time to work with individuals , if they go to him desiring to improve their game . nathaniel clyne ( left ) has credited pochettino for his development while he was in charge . victor wanyama seemed pricey at £12.5m but is one of their most consistent performers and will turn a profit if he moves on soon .
