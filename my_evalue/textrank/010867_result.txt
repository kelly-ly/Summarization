gemma lavender , all about space magazine : ' the lyrid meteor shower - while not as strong as the quadrantids , which were visible earlier on in the year - are still a worthwhile meteor shower to watch especially since it can offer up a sudden burst in meteor rate . ' in general , the lyrids usually peak at ten meteors per hour but one of these unpredictable bursts could mean that you’ll see anywhere up to 100 meteors per hour . ' these sudden bursts are fairly unpredictable , so you really need to wait and see if this shower will offer up any surprises this year ! ' the lyrids are active through to 25 april , although activity would have weakened by then , but it is possible to catch stray meteors over the next few nights . ' comet thatcher ( c/1861 g1 ) is the source of the lyrid meteors . ' earth crosses the orbital path of the comet and bits of rock and ice that thatcher sheds smash into our planet’s upper atmosphere at around 110,000 mph ( 177,000 km/h ) . another picture by john phelan shows lyrid meteors at porthcurno beach in cornwall .
