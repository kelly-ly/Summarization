lauren crawley was given a new platinum implant . i 'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect , but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy . to close it , i had to push the upper lid down with my hand . it was very stressful - i stopped socialising as much , in case people stared .
