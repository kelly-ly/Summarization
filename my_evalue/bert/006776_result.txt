' the stakes at this election have always been high . the labour leader also insisted yesterday that he had no plans to negotiate with snp . ' what 's putting the union at risk is the prospect of an snp victory in seats in scotland , and the reason why the snp have been doing well is the collapse in the labour and liberal democrat vote . '
