photographer ken hermann visited the market for his project `` flower man , '' which is a series of portraits that casts light upon the people behind the petals . although the composition of the majority of hermann 's portraits encompasses the flower sellers in front of a neutral background , other portraits forgo this characteristic and consequently bring a sense of movement and fluidity to `` flower man . '' hermann plans to return to malik ghat and looks forward not only to the opportunity to photograph different kinds of flowers -- as the range varies based on the seasons -- but also to the chance to present the flower sellers featured in `` flower man '' with their portraits .
