to commemorate st george 's day , the worlds of football and rugby have collided in a crossbar challenge between england stars of both sporting persuasions . nowell did hit the crossbar with a nonchalant kick during practice and uploaded the evidence with an instagram video and the caption ' happy # stgeorgesday ! however , when the competition started proper it was his team-mate ford who came closest with an effort that skimmed the bar . you can see me , @ alexoxchamberlain @ jacknowell & @ george_fordy in a special rugby v football crossbar challenge , the video is on my facebook page . #
