brian o'driscoll wo n't be thanking whoever snapped him crowd surfing at a party in hong kong any time soon after the picture went viral . to make matters worse the irish rugby legend 's wife amy huberman caught wind of the picture on social media , with hilarious consequences . o'driscoll has been in hong kong this week working as an ambassador for hsbc ahead of the hong kong sevens and clearly found time to unwind away from his commitments . on monday , at home in ireland , actress huberman posted the picture of o'driscoll and wrote : ' you know when your husband is away in hong kong on a very important business trip ... ' this was followed by a that read : ' i better get a giant toblerone from the duty free . ' sure enough , o'driscoll returned on tuesday , tail between his legs with the requested toblerone .
