i loved it . ' actress michelle collins left eastenders in 1998 after a decade of playing cindy beale ... only to make the leap to rival soap coronation street after a period of stage and screen work in 2011 . the lure of soapland proved too strong though and by 2011 , michelle had ditched less reliable stage and screen work in favour of a regular spot on rival soap coronation street . playing the landlady of the rovers return , michelle stayed until 2014 when she left amid rumours that she was unhappy with the lack of screen time that her character was being afforded . in recent years , the actress has appeared on reality television and even had a stint in los angeles but will be relieved to back in the bosom of british soap .
