defending champion bubba watson , hoping to win his third masters title in four years , will tee off at 2.24pm alongside england 's former us open champion justin rose and 21-year-old south korean amateur gunn yang , who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the us amateur last year . those watching the 2.02pm group on thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game 's most colourful characters go head-to-head . ian poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet , but even he might meet his match in american young gun patrick reed , who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at doral last year .
