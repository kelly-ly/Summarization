a photo of a relaxed and happy surfer seems all but a distant memory as that same man is now fighting for his life after being mauled by a great white shark . the 26-year-old is in a critical condition at the royal adelaide hospital after the horrifying moment which was witnessed by about a dozen other surfers who were in the water at the time and believed the six-metre creature swam away with the surfer 's leg and a surfboard in its jaw . another man said those closest to the badly injured surfer acted quickly without any thought of danger to themselves . ' however details of the type of shark and the man 's injuries have not been released or confirmed .
