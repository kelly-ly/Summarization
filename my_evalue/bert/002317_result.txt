you 'd think that being a chef , i 'd want to escape the toils of the kitchen while on holiday - but the opposite is true . meat and fish are plentiful and , because the soil is very fertile , the vegetables , fruit and salads are the glossiest you 'll ever see . no tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the river antione rum distillery - the last one in the caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar , as they did in the 18th century . belmont in the grand etang area is more to my liking .
