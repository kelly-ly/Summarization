we may not be able to hear it , but the earth is constantly oscillating and creating a hum that has been likened to the ring of a bell . this oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid-1980s found that the hum can drop as low as an e flat , 20 octaves below middle c on the musical scale . they did n't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds . although the majority comes from the latter .
