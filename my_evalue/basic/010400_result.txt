researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures , by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart . they discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage . professor robert ritchie , a materials scientist at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley , california , who was one of the co-authors of the research , said : ' our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skinâ€™s remarkable tear resistance .
