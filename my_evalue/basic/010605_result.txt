ten-man southampton lifted the premier league u21 cup , but they needed extra time , and a brilliant winner , to see off a stubborn blackburn side . the game was settled shortly before the break in the additional half hour , when sam gallagher unleashed a wonder-strike from long-range , after the two-legged tie had ended 1-1 after 180 minutes . gallagher , who made 18 premier league appearances for the club last season , but has not been in the first team this time around , smashed a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards , giving blackburn keeper david raya no chance , after cutting in from the right wing and playing a one-two with josh sims .
