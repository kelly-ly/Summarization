( cnn ) after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes . the ncaa 's claim that it 's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , mark emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that ' what we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the ncaa 's record tells a far different story .
