ed miliband will announce plans for first-time buyers to pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £300,000 . the policy announcements – labour’s most eye-catching so far in the campaign – are designed to counter tory plans to expand help to buy loans , the right to buy for housing-association tenants and to offer 200,000 ‘ starter homes’ , sold at a 20 per cent discount . but for so many young people today that dream is fading with more people than ever renting when they want to buy , new properties being snapped up before local people get a look-in , young families wondering if this country will ever work for them . eric pickles , right , said rent control is the most effective way of destroying a city - bar bombing it .
