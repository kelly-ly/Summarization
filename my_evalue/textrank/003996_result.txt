the tiny village of jose ignacio is an understated getaway for the rich and famous , filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts . during my stay , bankers , fashion designers and movie executives mingle over fresh breakfasts , discuss their plans to explore further afield and generally create a convivial atmosphere so very different from the hugs nameless , faceless hotels often found at beach resorts . chic beach houses are the order of the day in jose ignacio , with understated clapboard getting a modern twist and beach attire very much on the casual side .
