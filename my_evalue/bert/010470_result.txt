ed miliband 's poor leadership has been mocked by a labour candidate , who said it was like having ' a manager of a football team that you do n't rate , but you still support the team ' . paul gilbert even joked that he hoped his 'off-piste ' comment would not ' find it 's way back ' to the labour leadership , because he stands little hope of winning in cheltenham , gloucestershire . the labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job . mr miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on may 7 .
