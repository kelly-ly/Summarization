manchester city wanted isco when he left malaga two years ago but he chose real madrid over manuel pellegrini . it was a tough decision coming after his admission that the coach he had worked with on the costa del sol was like a footballing father to him . isco rarely starts for real madrid when all of carlo ancelotti 's main options are fit . isco could still play a big part in what is left of real madridâ€™s season but with the european championship on the horizon at the end of next season he will not want to have spent the previous campaign on the bench watching bale , benzema , ronaldo , kroos , modric , rodriguez and whoever else florentino perez signs this summer .
