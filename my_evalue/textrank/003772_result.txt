ambush : a base filled with stormtroopers and tie fighters comes under attack from unseen assailants . we then appear to get a glimpse of what has become of the empire - a squadron on the new look stormtroopers form rank in a snow-covered location beneath a new black and red insignia reminiscent of the old imperial one , surrounded by gun batteries and parked tie fighters , while a sole figue can be seen on a stage way in the background . the penultimate shot of the trailer shows the millennium falcon - whose pilot is as yet unknown - being pursued across jaku by a pair of tie fighters , presumably the same ones that were chasing finn and rey .
