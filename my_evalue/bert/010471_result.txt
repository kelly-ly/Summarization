an amateur cyclist is planning to ride the entire tour de france - considered the most gruelling race in professional cycling - on a raleigh chopper . and the wheels - on the first part of the race through northern france , there are a lot of sections of really terrible cobbles , so a guy made me some really strong wheels as i kept breaking spokes . ' mr sim hopes his audacious attempt to ride the tour de france will inspire others to take up cycling . with a bike , it 's mostly to do with the engine . '
