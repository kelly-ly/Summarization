in a letter to parents , the chairman of the governing body , tony hyams-parish , said : ' the governing body has terminated peter gale 's employment at nonsuch high school for girls due to serious breaches in applying safeguarding procedures and instances of unprofessional and inappropriate conduct . ' as you can imagine , this was not an easy decision . ' especially because we recognise that since peter 's appointment there have been many positive changes within the school led by peter and the senior leadership team . ' mr gale moved to the school after working as the deputy headteacher at rosebery school in epsom where he was responsible for curriculum , data and timetabling . his contract at nonsuch high school for girls ( pictured ) in cheam , surrey , was terminated due to ' serious breaches ' in safeguarding procedures .
