if you ever wanted to push the boat out ( literally ) and stay at one of the most unusual hotels on the ocean , look no further than no man 's land fort , a victorian sea fort in the middle of the solent , which is set to open this month . the sea fort is located 2km out at sea , meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat . those who have the means to splash out on the best suite in the fort , the plush lighthouse facilities can cost Â£1,150 a night during the summer . one way to make an entrance !
