covetous of the style of pattie boyd , marianne faithfull and edie sedgwick — andy warhol’s muse — i scoured the second-hand market in leicester , where i grew up , for sixties fashions . i have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in sixties style , and i vowed to one day have my own sixties abode . the first thing i did when i bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine sixties wallpaper put up .
