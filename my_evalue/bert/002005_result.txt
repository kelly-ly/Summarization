maths is a subject you either understand and enjoy or struggle through feeling rather bored . matthew weathers , who often posts videos of himself tricking his class on his youtube channel , put in a great deal of planning to pull off a lesson that would have engaged even the sleepiest student at the back of the room . wearing a baseball cap sideways , the rogue teacher closes the video causing the top-half of the real teacher to disappear before heading over to the legs – that dangle from beneath the screen – and attaching himself to them . the video concludes with the teacher announcing a quiz and the class clapping in admiration .
