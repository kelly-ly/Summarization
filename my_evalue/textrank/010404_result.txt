speaking about the disease , which affects 850,000 in the uk , miss mulligan said : ‘it’s quite quickly disregarded as being a sort of age-related thing , ‘ oh , granny’s lost her marbles’ – that sort of throwaway comment about somebody who has a brain disease… there’s not an awful lot of awareness in society . ’ mrs booth was once a gifted piano player and a geography teacher , who took a great interest in her grandchildren’s education . recalling watching the disease take hold , miss mulligan said : ‘ one of the last times that we were at home together with her , we had a meal and she sat down and she looked at her knife and fork , and she didn’t know what they did . ’ and every time miss mulligan begins a new play , such as starlight which she starred in last year , her mother sends her a good luck opening night card , signed ‘ from nans’ .
