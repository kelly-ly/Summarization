it 's that time of year again - the in between seasons moment when you look in your wardrobe and genuinely believe there is nothing suitable for the weather outside . use pliers to separate the necklace into individual jewels , position the pieces around the collar and simply use a glue gun to attach , instantly adding ‘ the glam factor’ as seen on matthew williamson and house of holland collections this spring . cut a rip just above the knee cap and then pull out threads and distress the edges for the perfect laid-back cool look . the flash of colour will refresh locks for spring .
