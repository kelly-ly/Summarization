that 's what kankakee county , illinois , sheriff tim bukowski said saturday about kamron taylor , the 23-year-old convicted murderer turned jail escapee until his arrest overnight in chicago . authorities around illinois had been looking for taylor since early wednesday , when he jumped a correctional officer at kankakee 's jerome combs detention center , then took off with the guard 's uniform and suv . bukowski said he expects that taylor will eventually be incarcerated outside kankakee county , in part because `` you do n't want someone to raise '' the idea that guards there might somehow seek retaliation for the attack on one of their own .
