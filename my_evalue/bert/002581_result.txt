a digital art student has used photoshop to show what her body might look like if she could mold it like modelling clay on a whim . kelsey higley , who studies art media at the university of oklahoma in norman , created a fascinating self-portrait of her body , showing what it would look like if it were digitally trimmed or augmented into various shapes considered beautiful . the resulting video , entitled ' manipulated ' , plays in a non-stop loop for over a minute and sees her proportions morphing into different shapes , often cartoon , highlighting the constantly changing beauty ideals that women face . the student artist browsed through hundreds of images of what might be considered beautiful and even changed the proportions of her eyes , seen as normal , left , and much bigger , right .
