this spot in colorado 's vail valley is so picturesque that a family stopped at nothing to build their home here - even if it meant shelling out $ 1 million just on the driveway . but the property is so remote that it took two years , a team of engineers and $ 1 million to build the 1.5-mile driveway from the roadway to its front door , the wall street journal reported . stunning : the home , which was built in 2008 , is made from materials brought over from the homeowner 's trips to italy . spacious : inside the 13,000-square-foot home is a spacious gourmet kitchen , which is perfect for entertaining guests .
