according to a document that will be issued to west ham fans on wednesday , every season-ticket band will be reduced when the club move . west ham 's vice-chairman karren brady said : ' we have always said that the move to our magnificent new stadium would be a game changer for west ham ; a chance to increase revenue , invest in the team and improve our performances on the pitch , but crucially without putting an extra financial burden on the supporters who already come to watch every home match . ' in addition , west ham will donate a seat each to the families of moore , hurst and peters for them to use for a charity of their choice .
