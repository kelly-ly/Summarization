barry beavis , 48 , lost his case at the court of appeal . mr beavis , from chelmsford , essex , had gone to court to fight what he called the ' bullying and threatening ' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces . ian taylor , of the alliance of british drivers , said : ' i think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think Â£85 is n't extravagant . ' but speaking outside court , mr beavis said : ' these firms are not run on a moral basis , they 're only out to make as much money as they can , to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists .
