prince harry will tonight fly out of the uk to australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private lindo wing at st mary 's hospital in paddington , where kate is due to give birth , in order to prevent what they describe as a ' media circus ' , excitement was mounting yesterday with royal ' superfans ' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil . she will also be known as hrh princess ( forename ) of cambridge after the queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to prince george 's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a prince of wales ( as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children ) was entitled to the honour . kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl .
