warrington crashed to a third straight super league defeat and could be in trouble with the rugby football league following crowd trouble in the cheshire derby . the game was stopped for eight minutes after a flare was thrown from the stand housing visiting fans but widnes maintained their focus to run out 30-10 winners and maintain their impressive form at the select security stadium , where they have taken seven points out of a possible 10 this year . a touchline dash from owens created the position for hooker lloyd white to burrow his way over from dummy half for the softest of tries .
