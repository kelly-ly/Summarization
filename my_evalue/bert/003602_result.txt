for most of us , the dream of a holiday home is one that will probably never be realised . from a lake garda mansion with a pool overlooking the water to an italian villa that looks like a castle and an antigua retreat with giorgio armani as a neighbour , these are some of the most spectacular holiday homes on the market at the moment . on the lombardy side of lake garda , this lionard property is a luxurious villa with one serious waterfront view . the home is currently listed for €30 million , just less than $ 39 million or about £24 million .
