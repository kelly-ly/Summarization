lawyers for natalie dimitrovska will on tuesday , in the supreme court of western australia , claim that ms vulin was not as badly injured as she stated in court , based on footage that shows her recovery filmed for channel 7 's sunday night program . dimitrovska , who believed her former husband was involved with ms vulin and was envious of her beauty , vowed to ruin her ‘ pretty little face’ . during dimitrovska’s original trial , in western australia’s district court , ms vulin described how she ' was pretty much instantly on fire ' during the attack . as she continues her long and painful recovery , spending most days in hospital and working with domestic violence and suicide prevention charities in her spare time , the dark prospect that dimitrovska could be freed early looms .
