it has been described as a durable and scratch resistant smartwatch and is a considerable investment , costing from $ 349 ( £299 ) . in a video , techrax drops the 42mm timepiece from a height of four feet ( 1.2 metres ) to simulate what may happen if a wearer drops their watch while tightening or unfastening the strap . while the screen could n't be used while in the pool , because of the capacitive screen technology , when it was fished out afterwards it functioned as normal . it also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard .
