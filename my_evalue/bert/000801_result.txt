atlanta ( cnn ) federal marshals have arrested scott kelley , a fugitive accused of kidnapping who was featured on cnn 's `` the hunt . '' `` but throughout the tape all i saw was this bizarre , strange conduct by the mother , '' rioux said , `` who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy . '' attorney alan rosenfeld has argued that genevieve kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter , after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they did n't believe the abuse allegations . and charles mozdir , another suspect who was profiled on the show , was killed in a gunbattle with authorities .
