five decades later , i find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation . but that is what rand paul , who today declared he 's running for president of the united states , is doing . i have no doubt that under paul 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the civil rights act -- which paul has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no department of education -- a department he thinks `` should be done away with ; '' when women did n't have choices -- choices paul seeks to limit in washington ; when dreamers were n't protected from deportation -- protections paul currently opposes .
