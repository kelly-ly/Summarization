the mother-in-law of one of one of the boston bombers has taken to the stand to tell how her daughter was converted to islam by her husband , as lawyers try to argue the other brother out of being put to death . defense lawyers for dzhokhar have made the argument that he should not be killed because he was in some capacity forced into the killings by his more persuasive elder sibling . david bruck delivered the defense 's opening statement in the penalty phase of tsarnaev 's trial , claiming that no punishment tsarnaev can be given is equal to the suffering of the victims . bruck told the court that tsarnaev would be sent to a supermax prison in the colorado mountains , adding that he would have no privacy , be under a video camera 24 hours a day .
