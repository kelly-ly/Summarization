first-time buyers will pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £300,000 and have priority in the sale of new homes under a labour government , ed miliband will say today . mr miliband will say labour’s reduction in the rate of stamp duty to zero would benefit nine in ten first-time buyers – saving them up to £5,000 in tax . labour claims its tax break – which would last three years – would be funded by a further squeeze on tax avoidance , higher levies on foreign buyers and cuts in tax relief for landlords who fail to keep properties up to standard .
