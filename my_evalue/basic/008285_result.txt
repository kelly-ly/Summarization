juventus moved ever closer to clinching a fourth straight serie a title by beating nearest challengers lazio 2-0 in turin . first-half goals from carlos tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back leonardo bonucci pushed juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining . the result brought lazio 's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals roma beat atalanta in the capital on sunday .
