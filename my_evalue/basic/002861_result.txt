this extraordinary video - captured when a skydiver dropped his gopro camera at 10,000ft - shows what it is like to freefall to the ground . the clip shows the very moment the helmet camera becomes detached and makes its dizzying descent back to earth . after what begins as a routine skydive - with two of the jumpers linking hands in mid-air as two companions circle them - the camera slips from helmet and makes its stomach-churning plunge to the ground .
