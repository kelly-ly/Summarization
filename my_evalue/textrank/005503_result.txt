a new york woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years . matilda kahl , an art director at saatchi & saatchi , wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers , white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because , as she explains to dailymail.com : ' when at work , i want to be judged on my work and my work only . ' in an article for harper 's bazaar , matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when , with ' a fairly important meeting on the horizon ' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction . she was asked if she had lost a bet , joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing .
