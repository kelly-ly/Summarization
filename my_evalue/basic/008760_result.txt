pakistan all-rounder mohammad hafeez is free to resume bowling in international cricket after remedial work and a re-test on his action . off-spinner hafeez , 34 , was banned from bowling after being reported for a suspect action five months ago in the first test against new zealand in abu dhabi and then failing an initial test on its legality . he was therefore unable to be selected to bowl in the world cup , but injured his calf anyway and was ruled out of the global tournament in australia and new zealand .
