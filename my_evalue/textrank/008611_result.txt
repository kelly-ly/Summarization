the chelsea boss said in a wide-ranging interview with the telegraph that the legendary manchester united manager showed him ' two faces ' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser . and after that i found the man with principles , with the respect for the opponent , with the fair play – i found these two faces in that period , and that was very important for me . ' in my culture , the portuguese and the latin culture , we don’t have that culture of the second face ; we are in football to win and when we don’t there is not a second face most of the time . he also had a frosty relationship with pep guardiola when the pair were rival managers in spain .
