now scientists have unraveled how octopuses manage to keep track of all of their flailing limbs as they crawl over objects . professor binyamin hochner , who led the research , said : ' octopuses use unique locomotion strategies that are different from those found in other animals . ' dr guy levy , a neurobiologist who also took part in the research at the hebrew university of jerusalem , said : ' during evolution , octopuses lost their heavy protective shells and became more maneuverable on the one hand , but also more vulnerable on the other hand . ' their locomotory abilities evolved to be much faster than those of typical molluscs , probably to compensate for the lack of shell . '
