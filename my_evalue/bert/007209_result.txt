a pair of friends who battered a married father of two to death with extreme 'jackass-style ' pranks and dumped his dismembered body in a lake have been jailed for life . they resorted to using a 4x4 owned by bradley andison , 47 , from kent , who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before the trial began . she said : ' neill buchel had a particular fondness for england as his grandfather had been a spitfire pilot in the war and neill had enjoyed the stories he used to tell . ' quye 's involvement was made ' even worse ' as he had told mr buchel 's 16-year-old daughter , who can not be named , the night before that he would care for her inebriated father , the judge said .
