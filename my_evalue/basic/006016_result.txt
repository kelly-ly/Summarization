stephen dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month . so it was surprising , to say the least , to see that photograph of two muslim liverpool supporters praying to mecca at half-time in an fa cup match . one of the men , solicitor asif bodi , 46 , from preston , explained that because the televised game didnâ€™t kick off until 4pm , the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground .
