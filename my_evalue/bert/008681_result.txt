it may look like a misshapen disk of metal , but this coin is one of the oldest ever to be found in britain . the find suggests that the village of saltford ( shown on the map with a red marker ) , where the coin was found , was on a major trade route long before roman times . we thought we would be writing the history of saltford from the roman times to now . â€˜ it was the first time that coins from the two separated groups have been found buried together .
