a giant supervoid 1.8 billion light-years across may be responsible for a mysterious ‘ cold spot’ in the universe . in the map , the universe is fairly evenly distributed , apart from in this one area . a supervoid is not empty , but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe . the supervoid is thought to be causing a 'less-dense ' region of the universe ( illustration of empty space shown ) .
