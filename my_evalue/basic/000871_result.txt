washington ( cnn ) as the missouri national guard prepared to deploy to help quell riots in ferguson , missouri , that raged sporadically last year , the guard used highly militarized words such as `` enemy forces '' and `` adversaries '' to refer to protesters , according to documents obtained by cnn . the national guard 's language , contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a freedom of information act request , is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers ' actions in putting down riots . in further comments emailed to cnn late friday , after the initial version of this article appeared , quinn insisted that `` while the term ' enemy forces ' appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language , they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission '' and claimed that the language was changed `` well ahead of the grand jury 's decision .
