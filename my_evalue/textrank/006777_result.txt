historian stephen chambers has collected more than 100 rare photographs , many taken by the troops themselves , including poignant images of soldiers from their preparation for the first landings right up until the evacuation . soldiers are seen being hosed down on the deck of the ss river clyde , a mule is hoisted on board the ship and even the moment a soldier makes the dash across no man 's land has been captured for posterity . mr chambers , who is an expert in gallipoli , which is also known as the dardanelles campaign , said : ' some of the shots are blurry because they are real action shots ' .
