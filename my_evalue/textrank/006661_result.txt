we do a pretty good job here in the united states as last year there were no fatalities from shark attacks . in countries where shark attacks are frequent , officials should clearly mark areas that are deemed ' safe to swim/surf ' and those that are not . there were only three fatalities record from unprovoked shark attacks in 2014 , two in australia and one in south africa .
