labour 's plans to change rules allowing wealthy foreigners to lower their tax bills is causing london property deals to fall through and homeowners to sell up , estate agents have claimed . although labour aides suggested this would raise as much as Â£1billion , it seems the announcement has already had a negative impact on the capital 's property market . charles mcdowell , an independent agent hired by rich families in the capital , told the financial times that two deals he was involved in had fallen through this week because of ed miliband 's non-doms plan , while two families asked him to sell their homes . it is not fair .
