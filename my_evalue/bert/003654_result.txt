if there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it 's the hassle of peeling it . but one canny youtube user , micahmedia , has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water . he simply puts his hand in the glass and in a matter of miliseconds , lifts up the shell of the egg which has been loosened from the egg . thanks ! ’
