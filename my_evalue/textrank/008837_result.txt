pacquiao 's trainer , freddie roach , believes his man is ready to beat mayweather in las vegas on may 2 . asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten mayweather , roach told boxingscene.com : ' that is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of manny . floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years . mayweather remains the bookmakers ' favourite for the $ 300million mega-fight next month but roach is adamant that pacquiao is primed to cause an upset . ' the 2015 version of manny is more mature , smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version , ' said roach . '
