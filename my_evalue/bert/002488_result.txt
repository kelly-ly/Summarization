the large hadron collider was restarted today after being turned off for two years during a major renovation project that cost Â£100million . after two beams of particles were sent flying through the tunnels at a speed just slower than light , cern 's director general rolf heuer said : ' congratulations . workers - who were earlier given easter eggs by one of the centre 's bosses - cheered when it was confirmed that the machine was back in operation . it took 50 years to find the higgs boson and 20 years to build this machine , and it will be running at least until 2035 , so we can be patient .
