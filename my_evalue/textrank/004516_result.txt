fbi director james comey has caused huge offense to a key u.s. ally by using language that suggested that poland was an accomplice in the holocaust . comey 's comments are particularly offensive to poles not only because they had no role in running auschwitz and other death camps where jews were murdered during world war ii , but because they were themselves victims of the third reich . polish leaders all had something to say about the controversy . ' to those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way , i want to say that poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of world war ii , ' prime minister ewa kopacz said on sunday .
