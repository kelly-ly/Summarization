left on the bench for wednesday night’s home clash with kilmarnock , perhaps uncertain over his place in the starting xi for sunday’s scottish cup semi-final against inverness , the celtic striker scored a 19-minute hat-trick to guide his team to a handsome 4-1 victory . the treble-chasing reigning champions came from a goal down , inspired by kris commons and the second-half introduction of griffiths , to record a win that takes them eight points clear at the top of the premiership – and lifts confidence ahead of their trip to hampden . celtic had begun the night with a starting xi looking very much like the team deila might have been thinking about for hampden , all things being equal ; leaving stuart armstrong and gary mackay-steven , both suspended for the semi-final , on the bench suggested that he was giving his cup formation a gentle run out .
