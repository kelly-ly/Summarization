roberto martinez will hold talks with kevin mirallas over his future at the end of the season as he stated his ambition to keep aaron lennon . mirallas was one of everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign but his form has tailed off following a number of hamstring injuries and he has wanted by tottenham during the january transfer window . it was mooted at one point that mirallas and lennon could be part of a swap deal but lennon arrived at goodison park on loan and has made a big impression on his manager ; it would cost £6million to make his signing permanent when the window re-opens .
