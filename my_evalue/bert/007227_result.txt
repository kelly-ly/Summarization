a swimming pool on the banks of the thames is one step closer to becoming a reality following lobbying by celebrity backers - with david walliams saying he will be the first to take a dip . the plans have moved far quicker than an initial ten-year initiative to clean up the thames for swimmers with the aid of celebrities such as artist tracy emin and david walliams . the baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around . thames baths , the community interest company behind the scheme , is hoping to promote the use of the new lido to local schools and the elderly .
