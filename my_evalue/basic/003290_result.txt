rewind those seven decades and guernsey 's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital st peter port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere . the ongoing channel islands heritage festival ( 3 april–11 may ) is a five-week hurrah of history , parades , concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – guernsey , alderney , jersey , herm and sark . liberation day itself will turn st peter port and jersey 's capital st helier into swirls of people and music .
