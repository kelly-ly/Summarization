a council has been slammed for ripping up more than 12,000 cobbles from a historic road so it can relay them to make it a smoother surface for cyclists . the council tested the technique on a small patch of paving and said the reaction had been ' overwhelmingly ' in support for the scheme from cyclists , pedestrians and wheelchair users . she said : ' we are making some adjustments to the cobbles in these streets to improve the surface for pedestrians , cyclists , wheelchair users , people suffering from arthritis and many others .
