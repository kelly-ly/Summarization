i met a syrian guy in a hotel in mersin who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days . when i reached italy the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i 'd be able to get some of it back . there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards cyprus the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a u.n. or red cross boat , anyone who could help us .
