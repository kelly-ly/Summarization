( cnn ) this week , hillary clinton surprised the world yet again â€” not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it . while critics may sneer , it is hard to deny that the image it projects of hillary is more confident , fresher , simpler and forward-looking , with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies , nike and apple . and if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate , that campaign will get into trouble fast . otherwise there will be messaging `` schizophrenia , '' the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she 'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008 .
