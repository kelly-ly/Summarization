my teenagers demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays , and given their obsession with all things kardashian , we decided on california this year . based in the funky hotel zetta - where the foyer-come games room and bar is plastered with colossal photos of john lennon and past guests of alcatraz - we spent three days hurtling around the city , often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the city 's hills . big sur : where the wild and often mountainous terrain battles it out with the equally wild pacific ocean . what a beach : huntington beach is a pure three-and-a-half miles of uncrowded white sand loved by surfers .
