kfc 's quiz contains 30 questions , which mostly ask applicants to rank their response from ' strongly agree ' to ' strongly disagree ' to questions which to some , might not have an obvious answer . mr phipps said that the test was not anchored to a personality type , but rather different work styles . ' in terms of personality or what have you , any personality fits in well at our company and then we teach them skills , but it 's a question of their values around work ethics that will help us , ' he said . questions range from those any job seeker would expect to be asked during an interview , to multiple choice scenarios .
