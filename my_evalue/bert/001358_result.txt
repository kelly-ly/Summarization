a passenger flying from newcastle airport to gatwick was pulled aside at security after staff thought his pease pudding was semtex , a plastic explosive . however , the traveller did admit he was carrying six tubs of the pudding along with pies from the greggs bakery - which became synonymous with the ' pasty tax ' introduced and then scrapped by chancellor george osborne in 2012 . it is not the first time unusual items have been picked up by airport security scanners . last year , customs officers at birmingham airport seized a giant squash from a passenger who was trying to smuggle it into britain from asia .
