fellaini could be targeted by mourinho in midfield as he looks to find a way of stopping united on saturday . i think there 's a case for bringing zouma into midfield , maybe get him on fellaini , because matic is left-footed and he wo n't want to put him on the right side of central midfield . ' ramires was also picked out as a potential player to be used in midfield , with willian missing out .
