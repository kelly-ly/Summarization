chelsea away is a tough one to come into ; thrown into the team to start at the barclays premier league leaders because louis van gaal was short of bodies . he has yet to score against the top level premier league teams , with his meagre return coming in games against everton , aston villa , stoke city and leicester city . when it all gets a bit narky out there , as it did in the movement leading up to chelseaâ€™s opening goal , which was scored by eden hazard after 38 minutes , terry excels .
