racing legend tony mccoy ended his career as a jump jockey without adding to his haul of more than 4,300 winners . mccoy was presented the champion jockey trophy by ian wright - mccoy is an arsenal fanatic . i have been very lucky and what i would say to the young lads in the weighing room enjoy every moment of it . ' heâ€™s fantastic on the lesser horses and he gets just as much of a kick out of winning a selling plate race as he does the gold cup .
