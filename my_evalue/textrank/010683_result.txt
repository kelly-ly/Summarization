i remember in moscow , at the last world championships , when i was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner , he killed me in the warmup . i always give a big smile before races because you never get bored of that feeling ; people cheering for you and making you feel like ‘wow’ all this training you’ve done in the winter and throwing up on the track , all the hard slog is worth it . after those guys have retired — sprinters like tyson gay and justin gatlin — it’ s quite open for people to step in and take the mantle .
