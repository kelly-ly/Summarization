a narrow two-bedroom home so small it is only 5ft wide in places has been snapped up for a staggering £750,000 . despite being only a little wider than a rugby player’s shoulders , the estate agency blurb described the property as being ' well proportioned ' . neither its dimensions nor its size put off buyers - with the estate agency yesterday confirming the home was now under offer . the backyard deck runs along the roof of a room in the tiny house giving the occupants a place to sit outside on sunny days .
