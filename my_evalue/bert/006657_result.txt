villarreal 's slide continued as a diego castro header gave getafe a 1-1 draw in la liga on sunday but the match was overshadowed by a serious looking injury to mateo musacchio . an ikechukwu uche penalty , after he himself was fouled by medhi lacen with 52 minutes played , was villarreal 's first goal in five league games but it was not enough to give them their first la liga away win of the year . villarreal have failed to win in seven games in all competitions and are sixth on 51 points .
