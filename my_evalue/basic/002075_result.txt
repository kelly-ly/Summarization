stokes was at the centre of everything on a hard-fought first day of the second test as england strove to set up the victory that is essential to their wellbeing . first the durham all-rounder injured himself , then he struck immediately when he came on to bowl and finally became embroiled in a heated dispute with marlon samuels that led to him being admonished by umpire steve davis . thankfully stokes was able to continue after treatment but was still feeling the injury when he came on to bowl , with england battling for the wickets they desperately needed to justify alastair cookâ€™s decision to insert west indies .
