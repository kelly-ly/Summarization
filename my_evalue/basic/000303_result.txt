lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from korea , china , the philippines , indonesia , and other asian nations , who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the japanese imperial army during world war ii . when japanese prime minister shinzo abe addresses a joint meeting of congress on wednesday , he has an opportunity to do right by these women , and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government . the resolution called on the japanese government to formally acknowledge , apologize , and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its imperial armed forces ' coercion of young women into sexual slavery ; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the `` comfort women '' never occurred ; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime .
