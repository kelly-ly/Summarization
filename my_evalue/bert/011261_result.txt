about 4.45 billion years ago , 150 million years after the solar system formed , earth was hit by a mars-size object called theia . three studies have provided different theories for what happened after earth was struck by a mars-sized object called theia , 4.45 billion years ago . the team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the mars-sized body theia was of similar composition , or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact earth . however , the other theory says that earth ( left ) and the moon ( right ) are so similar because the initial mars-sized object , theia , actually had a similar composition to earth .
