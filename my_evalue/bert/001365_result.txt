kevin pietersen 's attempt to impress the england selectors ended in failure in cardiff on sunday afternoon . pietersen was fortunate to escape with a mistimed hook off graham wagg , which just beat the fine-leg fielder , but he picked up the fourth boundary of his innings when he drove the ball over the head of left-arm spinner dean cosker . pietersen , who is hoping for an england return , had looked in good form before edging behind .
