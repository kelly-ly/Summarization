rapper 50 cent may have publicly criticised the crude manner adrien broner chose to rejection a contract offer by fledgling boxing promoter jay z but there does n't appear to be any hard feelings . the pair , with broner wearing a bright shirt and giant jewellery bearing his initials and 50 cent in all dark with a new york yankees cap , were watching the premier boxing champions primetime tv event featuring danny garcia swift and lamont peterson and irish andy lee against peter quillan . i 'm happy nobody got severely hurt i got love for both fighters but lamont is closer to me so i was going for him . ' that was n't a good idea to say that .
