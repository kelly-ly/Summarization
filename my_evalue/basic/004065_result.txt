west ham manager sam allardyce is not bothered by how manchester city will react to their slump , only that his own players produce the goods at the etihad stadium on sunday . a terrible run of form has seen city slip down into fourth place , their 4-2 loss to rivals manchester united leaving manuel pellegrini 's side well adrift of leaders chelsea and now in a battle to stay ahead of liverpool in the race for champions league qualification . however , west ham are also in need of some consistency , with a stoppage-time goal conceded at home to stoke denying them what would have been only a third league win of 2015 .
