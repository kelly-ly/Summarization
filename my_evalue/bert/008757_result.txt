a russian warship and two bombers strayed close to uk territory yesterday in yet another apparent attempt to test britain’s defences . a map showing the how jets were launched from raf lossiemouth yesterday , shortly after hms argyll was deployed to monitor a russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the english channel . under watch : the royal navy monitored a russian udaloy class destroyer ( not pictured ) along with a tanker and a support ship as they passed through the english channel . but sir michael graydon , former head of the raf , said the kremlin was using cold war tactics to ‘snoop’ on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a ‘resurgent’ russia .
