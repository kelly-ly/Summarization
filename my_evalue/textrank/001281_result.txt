rating : poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three-minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value . i keep thinking about phil neville , the former england footballer whose home once appeared in hello ! and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling . black and white : poets house incorporates smart , clean lines , elegant d√©cor and crisp white tablecloths .
