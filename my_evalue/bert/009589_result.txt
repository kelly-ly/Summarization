fc united of manchester , the club set up in protest at the glazer family 's takeover of manchester united , are now two promotions away from the football league . it was the perfect finish from the former macclesfield apprentice who was last week painting houses while on holiday from university . fc came into existence in 2005 when a group of united supporters , despairing of the debt-burdening old trafford takeover by the us-based family , decided enough was enough and created their own democratically-run club which kicked off at the bottom of the pyramid in north west counties division two . there 's no reason why the league is not possible .
