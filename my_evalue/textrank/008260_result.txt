no wonder the welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the aviva premiership clubs during the european rebellion last year . if the irish can not fully commit to a league – making it a fitting stage for piutau’s class – they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for european combat with their provinces . is anyone really surprised that trying to buy world cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal ?
