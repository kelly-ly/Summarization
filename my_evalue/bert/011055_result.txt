trainer paul webber was on sunday praying the ground at fairyhouse dries out further for cantlow , who will attempt to give ap mccoy a glorious send off in ireland with a second victory in easter monday 's irish grand national . cantlow’s form this season is not inspiring but he finished a creditable eighth in last year’s race when asked to carry top weight – only three of the last 20 winners have carried more than 11st - and webber has identified a reason why the 10-year-old pulled up quickly at kempton on his latest run . cantlow disputes favouritism for monday 's race largely due to the presence of mccoy on his back . ‘ mccoy is helped to lift the ryanair gold cup trophy by oisin loughlin at fairyhouse racecourse on sunday .
