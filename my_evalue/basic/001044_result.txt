hungarian architect matyas gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature . panels , some of steel , and some of glass , make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers , which equalizes the temperature across the building . while studying sustainable architecture at the university of tokyo , in 2003 , gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths .
