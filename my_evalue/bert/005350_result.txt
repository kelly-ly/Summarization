david cameron took on church of england bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies . but even so , in the toughest of times , my faith has helped me move on and drive forward . the prime minister said he had attempted to ‘ banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world’s problems’ , and instead it was about ‘ the right judgement… based on clear values and beliefs’ .
