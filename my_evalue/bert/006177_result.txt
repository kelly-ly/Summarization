sweeping is a tedious task but now a new ‘ smart bin’ could help save you from all that bending down with a dust pan . the bruno smartcan ( pictured ) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum . no more stopping , no more scooping , just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and bruno will do the rest . ‘ dust swept close to the base of the bruno smartcan activates the vacuum , which sucks it directly into the bin .
