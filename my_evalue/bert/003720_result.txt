liverpool 's fa cup semi-final defeat has put the club under scrutiny and guaranteed this campaign will be judged a failure . they have dispensed with two managers ( hodgson and dalglish ) and one director of football ( damien comolli ) since taking over in 2010 and will not hesitate to act if they feel things are going askew . raheem sterling is at loggerheads with liverpool over the new deal he has been offered . missing the semi-final will have done nothing to help his mental state .
