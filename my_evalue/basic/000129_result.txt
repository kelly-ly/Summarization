most people , including women , only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching , groping and stalking , not to mention the `` milder '' forms of ogling , leering , catcalling and whistling , even though all of this can be intimidating . it was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop i led that `` staring and commenting by men is normal and i 've learned to ignore it . '' over the past two years , i have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in india .
