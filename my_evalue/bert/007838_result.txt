easter is over for the wild rabbits of greater sydney as councils and parks prepare another attempt to kill them off with strategically placed carrots that have been laced with a deadly virus . the way we introduce the calicivirus in rabbit populations is first we chop regular carrots up and distribute them to different areas and see if they are going to eat them . ' while rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving , about 70-100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus , also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease ( rhd ) , which damages the animal 's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding . rabbits were introduced to australia by the british settlers with the first fleet .
