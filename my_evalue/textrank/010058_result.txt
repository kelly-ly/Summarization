nick clegg tonight vowed to block the tories imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future coalition deal . mr clegg’s insistence that he will not go into coalition with the tories if they insist on such deep welfare cuts increases the possibility that the lib dems could strike a deal with labour after the election . ‘ and a time when people are so cynical about politics , and so fed up with politicians isn’t it a good thing that a party , a plucky brave party put country before party and i have an old fashioned belief that if you do the right thing , that there are plenty of fair minded folk out there who will recognise that…was every decision a decision i would relish ? ' of course not .
