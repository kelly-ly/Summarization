investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 hillsborough disaster . it is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason i urge people to remember the warning issued by the coroner at the start of the fresh inquests , which he reiterated in february 2014 . ' it is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the hillsborough disaster on social media and forums . ' among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time .
