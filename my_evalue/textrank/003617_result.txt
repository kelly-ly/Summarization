adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for stuart mccall 's side , easter road chief executive leanne dempster and hearts chairwoman ann budge have lodged formal complaints with the league . none of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club , i can only apologise . ' when it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved , we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly , this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the championship . ' while it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the spfl , it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the championship to be played simultaneously . ' to move only one , ( or even two or four ) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations . whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures , the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 may are in no way unusual . ' after his side drew with livingston last night , however , ibrox manager mccall gave his view , saying : ' first and foremost , we 've not asked for the game to be changed .
