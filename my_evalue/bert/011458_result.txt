liverpool midfielder lucas leiva is relishing the prospect of a long-awaited wembley appearance after injury robbed him of the chance three years ago . we knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions , but i think we did well and we are so happy to get to wembley and hopefully get to the final . ' victory over blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain steven gerrard , who departs for los angeles galaxy , the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final . another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper simon mignolet , who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against rovers and even stopped opposite number simon eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time .
