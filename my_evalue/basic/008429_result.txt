many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid â€“ yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance . the fire brigades union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched . in one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed .
