in court testimony earlier this month , sloan , 51 , declined to identify knight as his attacker because sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends knight to prison , according to cnn affiliates kabc and ktla . knight 's attorney matthew fletcher has argued that knight was the victim and was only defending himself against sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time . the incident is the latest run-in with the law for knight , who founded the wildly successful death row records in 1991 and signed artists such as snoop doggy dogg ( now known as snoop lion ) and tupac shakur .
