britain bucked the trend of western nations by increasing spending on foreign aid last year while others imposed savage cuts . despite this , the uk increased its spend by 1.2 per cent to Â£11.7billion in 2014 . the oecd report , 2014 global outlook on aid , shows that britain is one of only five members of the dac to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid along with sweden , luxembourg , norway and denmark . but that is just 0.19 per cent of its national income .
