a russian aerospace commander has sensationally claimed that some spy satellites are masquerading as space junk in earth orbit . mailonline has asked the russian space agency ( roscosmos ) and space command for further information on the claim . the comments were made yesterday on ‘ space day’ , when russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - yuri gagarin ( pictured ) , on 12 april 1961 . since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space - and russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit .
