michael vaughan will become the most powerful man in english cricket if he is confirmed as paul downton’s successor at the helm of the national team . on the day that both strauss and stewart threw their hats into the ring for the new job , one source told sportsmail that vaughan’s appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before monday’s first test in the west indies . if vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and , if the position does remain , it is impossible to envisage peter moores surviving even if england win their test series against west indies . current job : broadcaster and columnist .
