outspoken mp bob katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the queensland government of believing embattled mp billy gordon was ' a little black puppet on a string ' . irrespective of his weird use of the term ' black puppet ' it 's kinda odd how bob katter is speaking on billy gordon 's behalf ' wrote benjamin james . mr katter used federal mps tony windsor and rob oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence , but he vowed mr gordon would not make that mistake .
