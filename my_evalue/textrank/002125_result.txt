mr carey , of fort wayne , indiana , has no memory of the fall but mr rawe remembers it clearly . as mr carey jumped off the ledge of the bridge , mr rawe ( left , top ) got his foot stuck on the railings , the pair then began to tumble towards the river bank 500ft below ( right ) without their parachutes opening properly . mr carey had to have a thumbnail-sized piece of bone removed from his spinal cord and mr rawe had some of his vertebrae fused with titanium .
