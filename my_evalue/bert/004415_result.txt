england 's premier bowler jimmy anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country 's all-time leading wicket taker in his 100th test appearance in antigua . anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first test in antigua . but even the england back-room staff were surprised that anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates jordan , stuart broad and james tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall . it was cj who caught me , a fella from here , so it was quite unlucky .
