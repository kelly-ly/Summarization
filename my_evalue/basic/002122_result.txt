the england captain , without an international century for almost two years , failed for the second time in the first test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by west indies . the double blow at the start of englandâ€™s second innings left them with much to do in this first test to work their way towards a winning position at the sir viv richards stadium even though they earned a first-innings lead of 104 . cook returned to something like his best last year with three half-centuries in his last four test innings against india but his woeful one-day form in sri lanka led england to jettisoning him as 50-over captain ahead of the world cup .
