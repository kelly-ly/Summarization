after the tour guests are offered three port wines - chip dry ( extra dry white ) , late bottled vintage and 10-year-old tawny - and they can pay extra to sample premium port wines . my tour included a stop inside one of the cellars , which houses nearly 2,000 barrels containing port wine as old as 1880 and a giant barrel capable of holding 100,000 litres . children stay for free , and the programme includes access to the well-being area , indoor and outdoor pools , and gymnasium . visit taylorâ€™s website for information on port wine cellar tours and tastings .
