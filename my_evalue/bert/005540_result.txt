the prospect of a ' blukip ' alliance between david cameron and nigel farage is now just as likely as a coalition between the snp and labour , nick clegg claimed today . the deputy prime minister said there was a ' very real danger ' that ukip and northern ireland 's dup could hold mr cameron to ' ransom ' in the event of a second hung parliament . mr farage said he believed many were in ' their hearts ' closer to his position of wanting an eu referendum as soon as possible without any attempted re-negotiation . yesterday asked what his message was to tory voters , mr farage called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum mr cameron has promised on eu membership by 2017 .
