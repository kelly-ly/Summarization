cristiano ronaldo left the pitch with a supporter trying to hug him , gareth bale left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after diego godin’s slip . bale was often the brightest of real’s front three but his miss was still the clearest . bale will not find too much consolation in the fact that he linked well with ronaldo in the first half . both bale and ronaldo scored in extra-time in lisbon and only an incredible performance from jan oblak prevented them from doing so in the first half . bale had embraced his pal luka modric just before kick-off and the croatian midfielder did his best to feed him at every opportunity .
