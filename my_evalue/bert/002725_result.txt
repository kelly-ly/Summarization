designer lilly pulitzer 's family learned that it 's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the ' pink sunday ' rush for the late ms pulitzer’s eponymous brand’s brightly-colored , limited edition collaboration at target . however , within 24 hours , many more sold-out items became available on ebay for under $ 100 , including a $ 9.99 makeup bag that sold for $ 19.99 and a $ 15 headband that sold for $ 30 . but though frustrated fans criticized target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies , these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store 's past designer collaborations . in 2011 , missoni 's collaboration with target crashed the website as well , and collections from prabal gurung , 3.1 phillip lim , and peter pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on ebay after selling out in stores .
