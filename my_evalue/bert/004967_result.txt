ludogorets player cosmin moti is guilty of producing one of the worst tackles you 're likely to see this season after his kung-fu style tackle on a cska sofia player - but unbelievably the referee waved play on . but moti 's kick on nikolic shows a different side and the misdemeanor during the first half went unpunished as his side went on to win the contest 4-0 - sending them six points clear of their rivals at the top . it could have been so different for the away side if he had been given his marching orders but due to some shocking refereeing , that was n't the case . the forward screams in pain after the horrific tackle and lands heavily on the ludogorets pitch .
