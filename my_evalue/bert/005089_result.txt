at half-time , everything pointed to another humiliating english defeat in dublin . it comes down to small margins and i thought the penalty at the end was a dead-set penalty to us . â€™ referee jerome garces showed watson a yellow card , despite the shameful pleas by three leinster players for him to be shown red , and leinster centre ian madigan kicked two more penalties in his absence to send his side in 15-5 up at half-time and seemingly in complete control . the 22-year-old ford was at the heart of everything they did while watson proved razor-sharp every time he received the ball .
