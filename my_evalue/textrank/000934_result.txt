stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between north africa and italy ; boat people have been arriving on italy 's islands for more than a decade . but what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation , specifically those in libya , because when moammar gadhafi was in control , he also controlled the flow of migrant ships . in 2008 , the-then italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi signed an historic friendship agreement in which italy promised to invest $ 5 billion in libyan infrastructure and gadhafi promised to close what he described as a `` spigot '' of migrants . once migrants arrive in italy , they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied , but italy has been sanctioned by the european union for not fingerprinting new arrivals . by law , italy has to take care of the arrivals , but many have no intention of staying in the country , and few of the reception centers are gated , meaning migrants can come and go as they please .
