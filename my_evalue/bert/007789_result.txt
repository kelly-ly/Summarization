when walking into the backyard of your seaside condo , the only things you would hope to find are the waves lapping at the shore , or a sunset over the ocean . property owners are now asking the city to designate the area for swimming only , which would outlaw fishing there and , they hope , drive the sharks back out to sea . homeowners say fishermen throwing bait into the water nearby are attracting the predators to their homes , and are calling for fishing to be banned in the area . they will eat almost anything they can kill , including fish , dolphins , seabirds , and other sharks .
