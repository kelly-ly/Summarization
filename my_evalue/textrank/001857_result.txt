kingsholm transformed into the house of fun on saturday night as gloucester beat exeter to set up a challenge cup final against edinburgh . greig laidlaw had opened the scoring and – to the tune of ‘ cheat , cheat , cheat’ after he craftily moved his kicking tee closer to the posts – henry slade levelled from 40 metres . elvis taione and jonny may exchanged further tries but – with the game finishing well into saturday night because of the late kick-off – it was gloucester who were left to enjoy the party .
