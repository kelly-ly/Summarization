( cnn ) i would have done anything to get to europe . there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards cyprus the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a u.n. an icelandic ship -- working in conjunction with frontex , the joint european union border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from new zealand . they took us to catania , on sicily , where we finally reached land a day later .
