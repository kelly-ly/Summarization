cunningham was forced to turn to a new half-back pairing in jordan turner and lance hohaia after skipper jon wilkin joined travis burns on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while paul wellens , restored to the captaincy , limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle , wigan could hardly have made a better start , with winger dom manfredi charging over for a try after just 52 seconds , reclaiming possession after turner 's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop lee mossop . matty smith kicked the goal to make it 6-0 and saints had to scramble to prevent manfredi and his centre anthony gelling adding to the warriors ' lead . wigan were indebted to a terrific last-ditch by george williams that brought down centre josh jones in full flight and , as the momentum shifted towards the visitors , it was no surprise when impressive forward louie mccarthy-scarsbrook charged over for a try on 15 minutes . the key moment came 10 minutes from the end when saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by wigan 's tigerish tackling . wigan substitute prop ryan sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when burgess won the race to george williams ' grubber kick , touching the ball down with inches to spare . ryan hampshire kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter .
