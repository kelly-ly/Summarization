winning a free trip would put a wide grin on most people’s faces , but one tourist couldn’t hide his ‘misery’ during a dream holiday to puerto rico . kevin said ' a dedicated friend ' took the photos that show him looking miserable during his holiday . thinking the post would amuse family and friends , the photo album has been viewed more than two million times on imgur and attracted nearly 3,000 comments on reddit . bonnie told mailonline travel that she didn’t ‘get’ the joke when kevin sent the first photo , and she assumed he was tired from travelling .
