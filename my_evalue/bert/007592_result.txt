a family of four was enjoying a day out together in portland , maine when a white man yelled a racial slur at them before speeding off . to partake in the joys of the first treats of spring can turn ugly without notice and , sadly , a visit to maineâ€™s most populous city yesterday was the day when the ugly became personal and my nine-year-old daughter learned that there are people who will never know her essence but instead will reduce her to nothing more than a n***** . ' she added in her blog post that while she was grateful for ward 's observations she was saddened that she was not comfortable enough following the exchange to come over to the family and ask if they were okay . ' she said her family was reminded that the world can be an utterly ugly place .
