george kidd , the chief commissioner of the direct marketing commission , said it would be investigating two firms . two firms exposed by the daily mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog . the firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the information commissioner’s office , which said the sale of such details was ‘ on the face of it , a very serious breach of the data protection act’ . both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the mail’s bogus cold calling firm .
