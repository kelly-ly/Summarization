there comes a time in a woman’s life when beach holidays just don’t cut it any longer , when lying on golden sands ( unless you’re buried up to your neck ) serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill-fitting your swimming costume is . last autumn i found myself spending a week in treviso , just outside venice , with a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks . jenny stayed at the villa bianchi , a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both treviso and venice .
