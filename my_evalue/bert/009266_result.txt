there was poetic symmetry in glenn murray 's humbling of vincent kompany at selhurst park on monday night . sure , pique was just 18 at the time and playing for manchester united 's reserves but he , like kompany , is all too aware of murray 's talents after the cumbrian scored a hat-trick against him in carlisle colours . before then he had turned out in non-league for workington , barrow , carlisle and even had a spell at wilmington hammerheads in americaâ€™s third tier . murray wheels away to celebrate as city 's defenders appeal in vain for offside .
