twelve months ago , liverpool were a free-flowing , potent attacking force with the ss ( luis suarez and daniel sturridge ) firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of liverpool 's 101 goals in the premier league.this season , however , the goals have dried up . with just seven games of the season left liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - raheem sterling , jordan henderson and steven gerrard - have scored six goals each . what the stats clearly show is that liverpool have not filled the void left by suarez , they are missing a harry kane ( 19 goals ) , a diego costa ( also 19 ) , a sergio aguero ( 17 ) , even a charlie austin ( 16 goals ) - and it has cost them dearly .
