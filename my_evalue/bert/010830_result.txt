ed miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ‘blubbed’ while watching pride , a british film released last year . at no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive . but in so many left-inspired british films of the past 25 years , whether brassed off ( about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a tory government ) , the full monty or billy elliot , thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice left-wing values with nasty right-wing ones . in his lavish £27 million opening ceremony for the london 2012 olympics he made no direct reference to britain’s greatest postwar prime minister — which was odd in itself — but left viewers in no doubt about his view of thatcherism .
