a bullish performance by exeter tighthead tomas francis could trigger a tug-of-war between stuart lancaster and warren gatland after the 21st 2lb prop helped end northampton’s three-month unbeaten run in the aviva premiership . the 22-year-old — who qualifies for both england and wales — is yet to pledge his international allegiance , despite having been called up to gatland’s training camp during the rbs 6 nations . with wales suffering from injury problems in the front row , francis ( right ) could be fast-tracked through the ranks to face england in the world cup pool match . however , saracens are confident fly-half owen farrell will recover from a knee injury in time for their semi-final against clermont auvergne .
