in the wake of the slaughter of christian students in kenya and the barbarity of islamic state militants , the most reverend justin welby said the dead were ‘martyrs’ . delivering his easter sermon in canterbury cathedral , he said : ‘ christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer and support persecuted communities , with love and goodness and generosity . ’ dr welby told his congregation that the killing of christians over the past year had been a ‘wicked’ development . dr welby’s praise of martyrdom was made as pope francis called for governments to intervene in syria and iraq . ‘ we ask for peace , above all , for syria and iraq , that the roar of arms may cease and that peaceful relations may be restored among the various groups which make up those beloved countries . ’ pope francis told the thousands gathered in the square for the easter mass that he prayed ‘ that the present absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence may cease’ .
