burgess is still adapting to the 15-man code with his ball-carrying technique coming under scrutiny . in league , for nine years , my game has been about taking short balls and looking for holes . another subtle difference between the codes is that in union players throw spin passes whereas in league , i was used to end-over-end passes . it was a great experience to spend time with the england squad .
