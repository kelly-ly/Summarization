risqué business : ceara lynch , 28 , says her career began when she realized how much money she could make from selling her used underwear online ; her first pair sold for $ 70 . in a recent interview with salon , ceara explains that she got started in the industry by accident . a tame entrance into the world of humiliating men for money soon escalated to selling more personal items online , taking provocative phone calls , and performing live webcam shows . i always play a dominant role , and i tap into things like cuckolding , small penis humiliation , foot fetish , toilet slavery , giantess — which is this fetish where guys imagine this giant woman that’s going to come and crush them with her feet or swallow them whole — different stuff like that . ' besides paying for subscriptions and purchasing the personal items that ceara sells online , customers can also mail ceara cash , buy her gift cards to amazon , southwest airlines , or a massage parlor , or purchase items off her amazon wishlist , which includes a $ 399.99 gopro , $ 1,295 giuseppe zanotti shoes , and a $ 23 pikachu adult cosplay costume .
