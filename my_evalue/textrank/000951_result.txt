the cave explorers told researchers at the university of bari what they 'd found , according to their report published in march in the journal of human evolution and phys.org . altamura man 's intact skull and jumbled pile of bones made for a great specimen , but they were wedged into a panoply of stalactites and stony globules deposited by water dripping over them for tens of thousands of years . researchers decided not to rescue the bones for fear that trying to ease them out of the cave 's calcified grip would shatter them and ruin altamura man . scientists believe altamura man wound up in the cave at least that long ago after falling into a prehistoric well , then died in the caverns at its bottom of thirst or hunger .
