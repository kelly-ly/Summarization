the tents are covered , but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water , especially around the edges of the tent . you occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water , but for the most part , nothing is being sold in the city . i do n't think they 're very concerned about looting , and there 's no military in the streets , but they will have to get water and food in the city soon .
