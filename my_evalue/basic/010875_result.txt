a report to the french government is urging eateries and customers to embrace ' le doggy bag ' in a bid to reduce the staggering amount of food thrown away each year . socialist mp guillaume garot , the author of the study , said while the popular us practice was previously ' unthinkable ' for snooty diners and chefs , a change in attitudes could save france up to €20 billion ( £14 billion ) a year . french diners have previously seen doggy bags - popular in america and the uk - as ' embarrassing ' , but one mp has said increasing their use would stop the country wasting huge amounts of food .
