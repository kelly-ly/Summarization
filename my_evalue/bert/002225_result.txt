quinton ‘rampage’ jackson has admitted he has already been through the wringer , even before he steps back into the octagon . i feel like the fans wanted to see me fight , a lot of fans bought tickets and wanted to watch the pay-per-view and see this fight so i 'm glad to be here . ' i am a true definition of a fighter , you know what i 'm saying .
