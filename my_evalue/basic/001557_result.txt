we take a look at the contract wrangle and ask : could he really end up at manchester united ? after weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the nou camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three-year deal with none of the strings , sub-clauses and trap-doors as the barca deal . only in as much as if manchester united had really offered him a three-year deal would he still be haggling with barcelona ?
