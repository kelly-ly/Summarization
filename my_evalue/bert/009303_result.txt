nearly 15 years ago an amazing story emerged of how a young japanese woman had travelled half-way across the world to try and find a suitcase stuffed with $ 1m dollars that had been buried in the snow . it was claimed that takako konishi had believed the film fargo was real - after all the hit movie begins with the words ' this is a true story - when she was found dead in a mini-skirt and high-heeled boots in the frozen wastes of minnesota just days after arriving . but it turns out that it was all a simple misunderstanding between a small town cop and the woman from tokyo who could not speak english . she met this guy and i do n't know if she was obsessed with him or in love but everything went wrong .
