upwards lightning is possible , but is very rare - with current estimates suggesting less than one per cent of lightning strikes travelling in an ‘upwards’ direction . and storm chaser dan robinson believes ' looped lightning ' is simply a trick of perspective , based on where the viewer is stood , meaning it appears to rise and loop even though it is not . the map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013 . areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple ; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer ( 0.4 square miles ) - are bright pink .
