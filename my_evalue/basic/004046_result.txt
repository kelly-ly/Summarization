target : groups of men and women were asked whether they would kill a young hitler ( pictured above aged 25 ) to prevent wwii . the answer , according to a recent scientific study , has a lot to do with your gender ; and women are far more reluctant to cause any harm in the short term in order to get a better result in the long run . they found that significantly more men than women would kill to save lives further down the line , while women were more troubled by the act itself and would often decide to do nothing .
