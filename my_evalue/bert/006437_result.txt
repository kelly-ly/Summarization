it was ten minutes short of 1am when javier hernandez left the santiago bernabeu last night . with the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance â€“ shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with ronaldo and isco better placed , and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period . he deserved the goal because he has never given in . he has already written himself a little piece of madrid history and reminded everyone what he can do .
