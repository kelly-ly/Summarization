neanderthals , like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london , may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to europe by modern humans as they migrated out of africa . but anthropologists from cambridge university and oxford brookes university say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of neanderthals . neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europeans now have roughly two per cent neanderthal dna .
