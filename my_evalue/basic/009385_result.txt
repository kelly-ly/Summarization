when she was a size 18 , julie was told she was too fat to run but she completed a marathon , left , and has done numerous races since , including one at the london 2012 olympic park , right . run for your life will show that anyone can find success with running , and show that women of all shapes and sizes that running can be fun and can be a great way of improving physical and mental health . i was told by a doctor i was too fat to run , and just three weeks later i proved him wrong by running the brighton marathon , but you do n't have to be able to run far or even fast to benefit from the joys of running , its all about taking part and being inspiredâ€¦even if you are still a little bit rubbish at it .
