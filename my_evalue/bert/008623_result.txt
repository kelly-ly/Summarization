ephedra foeminea ( pictured ) waits for the full moon to bloom and produces a sugary droplet to attract pollinating insects . at night , the non-flowering relative of conifers secretes tiny droplets of sugary fluid to attract pollinating insects . the study , published in biology letters , says : ‘ the exact timing of pollination in e. foeminea varied considerably from year to year , but was correlated with the full moon of july . ’ ephedra foeminea is the only known plant species to follow the lunar cycle , but dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung ( a stock image is shown ) and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities . ‘
