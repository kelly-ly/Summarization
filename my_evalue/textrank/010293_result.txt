i am not vain , rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery , when my mother rang for her weekly chat and i was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle , i probed her for beauty advice . facial exercises have been around as long as youth has been considered the hallmark of beauty , with some claiming cleopatra was the first celebrity fan . she also advises drinking more water and eating more protein .
