a sheep farmer has won an apology from supermarket giant asda after a leg of lamb she bought from them labelled as british turned out to be imported from the other side of the world . sue sharp was shocked to find a stamp on the Â£11 joint saying it had come from new zealand despite asda 's packaging claiming it was born , reared and slaughtered in the uk . asda says it has carried out an investigation into the mistake which revealed mrs sharp 's leg of lamb was the only one mislabelled at the galashiels store she shopped at . it was a bit of a shock and something i feel rather strongly about as a sheep farmer - the last thing i want to do is buy new zealand lamb .
