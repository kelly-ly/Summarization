the eossc2 is described as an ' ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities ' and is designed to connect to others to form a train . engineers at the dfki robotics centre describe the eossc2 ( animated ) as an ' ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities ' and plan on enabling it to drive itself . it pivots using wheels powered by separate motors and shrinks from 8ft ( 2.5metres ) to 5ft ft ( 1.5metres ) crabs ( stock image ) have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the eossc2 works in a similar way .
