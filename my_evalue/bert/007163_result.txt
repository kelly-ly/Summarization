ukip 's election campaign chief has admitted that the party sometimes resembles a ' rugby club on tour ' with members who can be ' boorish ' and ' chauvinistic ' . when that happens i make sure i express my own displeasure . ' suzanne evans , who is writing the party 's election manifesto , blamed the gap in support for ukip between men and women on ' lies ' and ' myths ' spread about the party . mr farage , who was absent from the women 's event , has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave .
