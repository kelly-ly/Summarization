the country’s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year . the figures from the trussell trust were seized on by labour and the tuc as ‘shocking’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so-called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits . in 2009-10 the trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits . research carried out by the trust , oxfam , the church of england and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks .
