( cnn ) looting , fires and violence descended on baltimore . these are communities , like the baltimore 's eastern district , in which more than 10 % of men are murdered . a nice retired african-american gentleman calls 911 because the kids in front of his house , also black , are rowdy , breaking bottles , selling drugs , and otherwise being disrespectful . sometimes i would get out of my car .
