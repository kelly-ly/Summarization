( cnn ) as we approach april 27 when south africa marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994 , we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against african migrants . the question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam , as if the majority of black citizens and african migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white south africans or white foreigners . attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of south africa 's black majority experiences segregation , persistent and relative poverty , and high crime rates in post-apartheid south africa is paramount .
