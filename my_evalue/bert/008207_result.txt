nico rosberg fears the threat from ferrari in this weekend 's bahrain grand prix , describing their pace as ' dangerous ' and ' worrying ' . tyre wise , it is pretty straightforward , with both tyres ( the soft and medium-compound pirellis ) quite robust . they look very good , from what i can see , in the long run . ' mclaren 's jenson button also suffered a wretched day with technical issues in both sessions , resulting in a lack of running that left him down in 19th position , 4.5 seconds behind rosberg and sandwiched between manor duo will stevens and roberto merhi .
