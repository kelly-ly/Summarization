young women can still get cheaper car insurance than young men despite sex equality laws , an economist warned yesterday . someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 , he said . dr mcdonald , who presented his research to a royal economic society conference , warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions . it looked at six professions : civil engineers and plasterers , who are nearly all men ; solicitors and sports hall staff , who are roughly evenly split by sex ; and social workers and dental nurses , who are mostly female .
