a young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry . kyli wilfson , a self-confessed ‘ food person’ , was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘ kicked in the abdomen ' – whenever she ate , a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘ resolve itself’ in a matter of days . kyli , now 29 , was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis , and the north carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube , as the disease , which effects less than .01 per cent of people , would only get worse .
