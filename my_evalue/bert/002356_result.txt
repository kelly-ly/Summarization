my first trip to new york was with my aunt when i was about 18 and i had been appearing in coronation street for about 12 months . we valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area , and it came in really handy because during our stay sylvain 's cousin in new york celebrated his 30th birthday , so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly . it was sylvain 's first visit to new york and he absolutely loved it . that would have been the icing on the cake .
