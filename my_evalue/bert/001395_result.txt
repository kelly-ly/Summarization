a second liberal democrat election candidate has revealed he is hiv positive as he launched a scathing attack on nigel farage for his comments on the condition during last week 's tv debate . the election candidate is the second lib dem to go public with their hiv positive status , after adrian hyyrylainen-trett , who is running for the party in vauxhall , central london , explained that he got the virus intentionally as he embarked on a path of self ' annihilation ' . i knew a little bit about what hiv meant because i’d done some work with a gay men’s health charity in glasgow but i still had in my head that it was a terminal diagnosis . hiv is a drop in the ocean compared to what else the nhs is spending money on .
