she 's been living in new york for a year now , and it seems that princess eugenie is right at home in the cosmopolitan city . the british royal , who is currently working in new york , showcased her hipster style for the second day in a row wearing a black bowler hat , black leather top and a black and cream miniskirt . luckily for our bank balances , eugenie is a high street gal at heart ( apart from the odd shopping spree at intermix ... ) and this is the second time this week we 've spotted her wearing affordable pieces .
