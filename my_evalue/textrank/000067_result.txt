( cnn ) one year after it was perpetrated , the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend : hundreds of teenaged girls , just finishing school , destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped , never to be seen again . the government girls secondary school had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by boko haram militants , who are opposed to western education , particularly for girls . nigeria 's current president , goodluck jonathan , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat boko haram .
