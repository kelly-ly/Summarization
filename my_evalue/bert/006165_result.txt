there would have been no mercy in the dressing room . but stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to england coach peter moores . peter moores , englandâ€™s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with marlon samuels in the second test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . what stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed .
