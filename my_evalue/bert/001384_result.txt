sales of a burberry poncho ( modelled by cara delevigne ) carrying a personal monogram and costing more than Â£1,000 have helped boost profits . the ponchos - together with heritage trench coats and scarves - have boosted burberry sales by 10 per cent over the winter . and while the original inspiration for the designs may have been a rather modest attempt to keep out harsh weather , there was nothing modest about the burberry version . models led by cara delevigne wear the poncho on the burberry catwalk ( left ) while british model rosie rosie huntington-whiteley wore hers on a recent shopping trip , specially monogrammed with her initials .
