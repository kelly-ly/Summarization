law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit . indeed , just this week a 16-year-old from gateway high school in kissimmee , florida , was arrested for posting about a bomb threat on twitter because ' she was angry and did not want to go to school , ' according to the osceola county sheriff 's office . in a separate case , a 14-year-old in western michigan was ordered by a judge to pay nearly $ 8,000 in restitution to the coopersville area public schools and the ottawa county sheriff 's office for his involvement in a swatting incident that put schools in lockdown after a caller using computer-based technology made threats against the schools .
