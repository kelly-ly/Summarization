mothers across the globe have been left outraged by an alleged religious community that is criticizing moms for having cesarean sections instead of natural childbirths â€“ creating a series of insulting campaign images , or memes , that claim they ' did n't really give birth ' . public shaming : this meme featuring a mom in a bikini states that women should n't flaunt their stomachs after having cesarean sections because they did n't take care of themselves while they were pregnant . unfair claims : the disciples of the new dawn also believe that there is ' no medial need ' for cesarean sections when giving birth .
