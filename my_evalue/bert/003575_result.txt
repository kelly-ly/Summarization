it started out as a sweet family moment on a day trip to the zoo : a little girl beating her chest at a gorilla , safely separated by a pane of glass . but it seems the silverback at the nebraska zoo was less amused . the massive animal - who had been standing at the back of the enclosure - clearly decides enough is enough , and runs at the onlookers . horror : the family 's terrified reactions were captured in the glass the moment they gorilla hit .
