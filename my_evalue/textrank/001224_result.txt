this puzzled puffin was spotted flying into london along the thames , close to the a4 flyover at brentford . steve knight , of the swan sanctuary in nearby shepperton , caught the bird , which has now been handed over to a specialist centre in dorset , where he is being nursed back to full health . i gather they normally eat sand eels but there aren’t too many of them in the grand union , so we gave him some whitebait . ’ sanctuary founder dot beeson added she believes the puffin got lost or was blown off course by recent winds .
