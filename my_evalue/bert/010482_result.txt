this is the amazing scene as a freelance photographer risks his life to capture an image of a hungry lion from just a few feet away . fearless atif saeed , 38 , from lahore , pakistan was in the city 's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance . mr saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames . was laughing at that time , but now when i think back about the incident i donâ€™t think i would be able to do it again .
