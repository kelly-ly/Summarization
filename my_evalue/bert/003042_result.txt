ordinary british tennis fans face a wimbledon-type scramble for davis cup quarter-final tickets this summer and are likely to end up with less than half the overall allocation . there will be a capacity of 7,000 for july 's match against france at london 's queen 's club , but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in glasgow for last month 's first round . a by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight .
