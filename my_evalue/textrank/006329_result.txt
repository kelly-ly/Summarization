tamplin was jailed for two years at january 's sentencing hearing , but mr recorder stuart trimmer qc spared starrs jail as an ‘ act of mercy’ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a £1,500 fine . ‘ what the recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn’t available to him . ‘ the judge should have been told what his powers were . ’ prosecutor john ojakovoh said starrs offered a ‘ blank cheque’ at sentencing and has already paid back the £28,000 he stole .
