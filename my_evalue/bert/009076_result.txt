an australian teenager has joined the puffy pout craze by using a shot glass to pump up her lips to ridiculous proportions . she freaked herself out even further when after applying bright red lipstick which created a clown effect . countless teens , both boys and girls , have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on twitter and instagram , which in many cases has led to severe bruising around the mouth . i just wanted to try it and see what they would look like , i 've never done it before , and i wo n't be doing it again .
