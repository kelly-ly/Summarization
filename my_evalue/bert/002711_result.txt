she 's been photographed hundreds of times and starred in magazines and tv advertisements but you wo n't have seen her face - until now . not one to put her assets at risk , emily , a former beauty writer , moisturises her hands up to ten times a day to keep them looking their best . she exfoliates them once a week and always wears a strengthener to keep her nails from snapping . sometimes i ask other people to open bottles or packets for me when i have a big job coming up as i do n't want to risk any scratches or breakages .
