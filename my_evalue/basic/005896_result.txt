i remember standing at the back of leeds kop , maybe i was 15 or 16 year old and yorath and hankin were getting booed . rangers manager stuart mccall has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters . mccall hopes that for the time that he is manager of rangers , mcculloch will be the last player to get booed .
