the ultimate goal of extrasolar planet research is to find planets like earth that may support life . ' this discovery shows the type of planetary system that astronomers expect to find around many nearby stars in the coming years . ' starspots , like sunspots on the sun , can momentarily mimic the signatures of small planets . ' repeated observations over many years allowed us to separate the starspot signals from the signatures of these new planets , ' explains evan sinukoff , a uh graduate student who contributed to the discovery . fulton will lead this two-year search with the apf as part of his research for his doctoral dissertation . ' when the survey is complete we will have a census of small planets orbiting sun-like stars within approximately 100 light-years of earth , ' says fulton .
