mr morrison believes there is essentially no excuse to excuse a parent when they decide not to vaccinate their child , especially as the decision could be potentially fatal for other children . “ the idea that your child’s going to a childcare centre and that some other parent doesn’t feel they like the science of immunisation , and therefore they come along and your child or anyone else’s child could catch something because some other parent has an opinion , that isn’t really good enough is it , ” he said . childcare centres in nsw can ban children that are not immunised and other states are currently considering similar tough stances .
