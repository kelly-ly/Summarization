the rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides , which sit in a separate block from the main table . in a paper published in the journal foundations of chemistry last month , he said : ' though there are many misconceptions concerning the nature and function of the periodic law and table , perhaps the most prevalent among modern chemists is the belief that the periodic table is nothing more than an electron configuration table . ' while there is certainly a significant correlation between electron configurations and chemical periodicity , the correlation is far from perfect . ' lutetium and lawrencium , rather than lanthanum and actinium , should be assigned to the d-block as the heavier analogs of scandium and yttrium , whereas lanthanum and actinium should be considered as the first members of the f-block with irregular configurations . ' lawrencium , represented by the diagram left , was discovered by nuclear scientist ernest lawrence ( right ) . this representation of the periodic table shows the ionisation potential of elements following the new results .
