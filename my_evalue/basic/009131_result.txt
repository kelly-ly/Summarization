edinburgh’s european challenge cup hopes have been dealt a huge blow after scotland international centre matt scott was ruled out until at least the end of the season . he had played a major role in edinburgh’s run to the european challenge cup semi-final where they play newport gwent dragons at bt murrayfield on friday . with glasgow’s alex dunbar also a major fitness doubt for the world cup , scott’s injury could leave scotland coach vern cotter with a big gap to fill at centre .
