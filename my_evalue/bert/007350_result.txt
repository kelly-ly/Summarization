an egyptian goose that lived for at least a week with an arrow piercing its neck as it evaded capture by animal control workers in southern california died after it was wrangled and taken to surgery . she said the bird 's skin had healed around the arrow and made the process more difficult . animal officials had high hopes for the bird 's recovery after its capture earlier wednesday because it seemed in otherwise good health and the arrow had missed all its vital organs . a worker at the anaheim hills car wash befriended the goose several days ago by feeding it bread crumbs and was able to catch it and turn it over , ingram said .
