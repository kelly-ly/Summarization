there was no glorious team sky send-off for sir bradley wiggins despite a terrific effort from the briton in the paris-roubaix . the 2012 tour de france winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad , ' wiggins ' , before a return to the track ahead of the rio olympics , and wanted to sign off from what he called a ' golden era ' with a win in one of the sport 's most prestigious races . degenkolb celebrates his win alongside zdenek stybar ( left ) and greg van avermaet ( right ) . he found some extra power to go it alone again but the top prize was no longer on the table for him and he was amongst the rest as degenkolb won the race in two laps of the roubaix velodrome .
