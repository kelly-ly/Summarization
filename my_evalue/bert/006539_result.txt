faced with deplorable conditions at a ‘horrendous’ hotel in cyprus , two lads from cambridge tried to make the most of it by creating a hilarious video diary for their friends back home . the three-and-a-half minute video , titled ‘ never letting him book a hotel again’ , offers a glimpse into every traveller’s nightmare – dirty rooms , antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter . this screen grab from the pair 's video shows the hot tub filled with stagnant water and dead flies . it then pans even further to the deep end , which is filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris .
