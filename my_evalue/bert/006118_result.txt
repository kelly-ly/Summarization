ian bell rescued england from a nightmare start with a century in the first test against west indies that was pay back time for being dropped during his last caribbean series . and bell rates his hundred one of the best of his 22 â€“ only alastair cook ( 25 ) , out for another low score , and kevin pietersen ( 23 ) have scored more . it was my day today , but hopefully it will be someone else 's day in the next innings . ' kemar roach runs away to celebrate bowling alastair cook out for 11 on the first morning of the test .
