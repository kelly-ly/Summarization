alastair cook still has the full support of his coach , team-mates and selectors and is unbeaten in four tests . the decision of graves and harrison to sack paul downton as managing director and announce that they are looking for a new ‘supremo’ to replace him has placed cook and peter moores under more pressure than ever . there is much promise in this england team , particularly in a middle order that will see one of moeen , jos buttler or ben stokes batting as low as eight , but questions remain about the man at the top .
