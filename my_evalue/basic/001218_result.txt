rangers ace david templeton promotes tickets for sunday 's match against hearts at ibrox . hearts romped to the title with seven games to spare and currently sit 26 points in front of a rangers side fighting to finish as best of the rest ahead of the play-offs . it was just one of those things , it was a good move at the time and if we can go up through the play-offs then i still think it would have been a good move .
