a bizarre performance from stan wawrinka saw grigor dimitrov breeze through 6-1 , 6-2 to his first masters quarter-final of the season . the world no 9 looked listless and disinterested , rolling in 95mph first serves and ballooning groundstrokes long . wawrinka 's coach magnus norman is not in monte carlo this week and , watching at home , he may have been glad of the opportunity to turn off the television . the world no 11 broke early and wawrinka served to stay in the match at 5-2 down .
