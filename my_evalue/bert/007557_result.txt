louis van gaal said that is is a great time to be a manchester united supporter after they crushed manchester city 4-2 at old trafford on sunday . we are four points ahead of the fourth place in the table and i am very happy for the fans because i have seen what it meant to them when the results were not so good . ' maybe the third goal was offside and something similar happened in the last game but i 'm not talking about referees . '
