a 73-year-old reserve deputy shot and killed a man during an undercover operation after thinking he had his stun gun when he opened fire . my attorney has advised me not to comment . as he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs , he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun . with the same power as paid deputies , reserves can conduct their own investigations , make arrests and work on task forces .
