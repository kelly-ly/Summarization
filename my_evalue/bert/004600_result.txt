a company has copped a spray after making the ' tasteless decision ' to link its product to the tragic murder of school teacher stephanie scott . another post said the post was a ' rubbish ' effort to use ' a grassroots social media movement for a murdered woman for social relevance ' and the brand is ' jumping on a bandwagon ' . ms scott was due to marry her partner aaron leeson-woolley on saturday . it has also posted cartoons linked with australia 's cricket world cup victory , the release of apple 's iwatch , netflix 's australian launch , and mardi gras celebrations in sydney .
