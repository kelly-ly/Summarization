josh warrington admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against dennis tubieron as he eased to a lop-sided points win in leeds . the 24-year-old has been billed as the next ricky hatton due to his impressive fan base and close to 10,000 packed into the first direct arena on saturday night . tubieron fought for the same belt last december when he drew with carlo magali and the filipino 's record of 19 wins from 24 fights suggested he would struggle against warrington who is now unbeaten in 21 contests .
