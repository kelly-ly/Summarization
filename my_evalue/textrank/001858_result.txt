england are in danger of losing their fourth champions league spot in the coming years , as poor performances from premier league clubs in europe take their toll . italy and germany will lose a significantly smaller number of points ( 11.571 and 15.666 respectively ) meaning that by the beginning of next season , england will have slumped to third , and be in danger of falling further . and even if next season does n't see england slump to fourth , without a significant reversal in the fortunes of premier league and serie a clubs in the next two years , the season afterwards would see england in major trouble .
