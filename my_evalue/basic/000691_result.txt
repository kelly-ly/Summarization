new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher . boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by shakespeare , nine by fletcher and 12 by theobald to create a `` psychological signature '' of each author based on word choices , phrase patterns and other factors . they compared those profiles to the language in `` double falsehood '' and determined that the play 's first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare , though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher .
