welcome to the exoplanet hd 189733b , where temperatures reach 3,000°c ( 5,400°f ) and winds are in excess of 620mph ( 1,000km/h ) . the findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail . the planet was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that mercury is to our sun , completing an orbit in just 2.2 days . the scientists found that the temperature on the planet ( illustrated ) increases dramatically with altitude – up to 3,000c in the upper atmosphere , hot enough to melt lead .
