a team of archaeologists at boston university and the university of bath believe this would have meant they lost out when modern humans arrived from africa . neanderthals , like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london , may have finally died out as they were unable to get as much energy from their food as modern humans who used fire . neanderthals use of fire is still a highly controversial issue , but if they had not used it to cook food as much as modern humans it would have put them at a definite disadvantage .
