a picture posing with a st bernard dog in front of the snowy peak of the matterhorn must top the list for the ultimate swiss souvenir . the organisation has been calling for the town council of zermatt to ban the use of the dogs for many years . zematt has shown that it loves the animals and it will put an end to the contemptible and dangerous shows these dogs were made part of by being used as tourist props . ' mailonline has contacted the st bernard owners for comment .
