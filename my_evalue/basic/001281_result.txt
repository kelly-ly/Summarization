rating : poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three-minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value . which is to say that poets house is glossy and lavish , but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch , not least because the finish is so good . no , it might not be to all tastes ( there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them , such as lines from kipling : ' since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house , friend comforting friend ' ) and the floors are given over to black-and-white squares with embedded stars .
