graeme mcdowell insisted he would never consider not playing the masters despite another frustrating experience at augusta national . it is a celebration of golf on my favourite golf course in the world . i love it . you have to be a 'front-edge ' putter like bubba ( watson ) , i 've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than bubba .
