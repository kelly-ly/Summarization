a cheeky monkey was captured on camera snatching a banana from a female tourist before slapping her gopro when she got too close . the curious monkey gets right up to the camera lens and gives it a sniff . startled by the monkey’s reaction , its friend who sits next to it looks genuinely shocked and rather hilariously raises its eyebrows in surprise . the footage was captured by maja and diano , a pair who describe themselves on their youtube channel as a ‘ young married couple with an impulse to explore , film and edit great travel moments . ’ slap !
