ben stokes pulled his shirt across his mouth before smiling at marlon samuels , as if to declare a truce in their feud . it may seem harsh to criticise a tail-ender who had hung around valiantly in a last-wicket stand of 34 as root moved majestically to his latest ‘daddy’ hundred . so , anderson would have been delighted with his 387th test wicket as he swung the ball in at devon smith and saw the local boy became the latest batsman to drag the ball on to his stumps on this slow pitch . it looked like being a frustrating day all round for broad , as the west indies set about nullifying england 's lead on a dead pitch .
