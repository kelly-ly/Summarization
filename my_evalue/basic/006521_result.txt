real madrid have n't got going tonight ( i was about to write a post about how barcelona were 5-0 up at this point ) but james rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring . things may get better now though , it 's ronaldo time again with the dead ball ... but oh dear . javier hernandez gets space down the left flank and his first time ball is just inches away from cristiano ronaldo at the back post .
