the wife of a detroit-area soccer referee filed a $ 51 million lawsuit friday against a hot-headed player who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer . the figure represents $ 1 million for each of the 51 additional years that john bieniewicz , 44 , could have lived , according to the lawsuit in wayne county court . bieniewicz died after saad punched him in the head just moments before saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in livonia . in 2005 , saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field .
