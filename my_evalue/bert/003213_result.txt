japan 's j-league is just four games into a new season , but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent 's face . videos of the south korean defender kim min hyeok , who plays for sagan tosu , have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent mu kanazaki . after kanazaki went down , it is alleged that hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent . however , regardless of the controversy , justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on playerâ€™s team won 3-1 , with kanazaki among the goals .
