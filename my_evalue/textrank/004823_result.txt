a reading university researcher has said that bees prefer cities to fields ( honey bees in paris shown ) . wildlife sites in four english counties saw bee species decrease . while the gardens , parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season , popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks ( stock image of honey bee shown ) .
