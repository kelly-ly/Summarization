rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory , steering his shot past a stranded david forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser . rovers , who lost captain matt kilgallon to injury in the first half and had to play debutant darragh lenihan in central defence , had their fair share of chances , but it needed a touch of class to make the difference . manager gary bowyer is realistic enough to know that they might not both be at ewood next season .
