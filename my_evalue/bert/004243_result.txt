everybody knows that new york is called ‘ the big apple’ , that london is known as ‘ the old smoke’ and that paris is referred to as ‘ the city of love’ – but do you know why ? harry peters , from just the flight , told mailonline travel : ' block 16 and the surrounding area was demolished after the second world war , and las vegas as we know it today was built up around it – but the ‘ sin city’ nickname has stuck , and is still rather relevant today . ' the history of philadelphia is recognised by its nickname of ' the city of brotherly love ' . and paris might be known as ' the city of love ' for its romantic architecture and stunning landmarks , but it is tagged ' the city of light ' after it became the first in europe to use electric street lamps .
