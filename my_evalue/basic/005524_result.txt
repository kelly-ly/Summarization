the newly-opened parisian hotel , maison souquet , may just be the more provocative hotel in the entire city of lights . whether grabbing a drink in the lounge or hidden champagne bar or checking in to the one of the property 's extravagant suites , the plush velvet and gold-accented interiors , designed by jacques garcia , are not to be missed . but no matter which room you choose , all guests will see hermes bath products , plenty of silk draping and have the option to rent out the spa and swimming pool for a private dip under the starry ceiling .
