israel marked its annual day of remembrance for fallen troops and slain civilians on wednesday , with the country standing to attention for two minutes while sirens wailed . in recent years the remembrance day has been expanded beyond commemorating those soldiers killed defending israel , but also security personnel who died protecting the state from terrorist attacks . that year , 1860 , is when israel considers to be the start of the conflict with the palestinians when jews founded the first neighbourhood outside the walls of jerusalem 's old city . visitors pay their respects to fallen service personnel at a military graveyard in tel aviv .
