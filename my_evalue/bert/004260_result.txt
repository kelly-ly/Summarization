those who achieve greatness are high achievers from an early stage . another pfa young player of the year award winner ( 1995 ) , he had entered the record books by scoring the fastest hat-trick in the barclays premier league on his way to 50 goals by his 20th birthday and won his first major honour ( the 1995 league cup ) . great ? but i can only focus on here , liverpool and what is best for now .
