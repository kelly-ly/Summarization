david cameron this morning attempted to explain away how he forgot which football team he supported - by claiming it was because he 'd seen another club 's ground the day before . mr cameron was asked to show his support for aston villa by naming the year of the club 's famous european cup final victory in 1982 . the pm said : ' it was early 80s , i 'm not going to give you a date because i 'll get it wrong . ' he said : ' i 've been an aston villa fan all my life , i literally opened my mouth and i was going off-piste about the fact that in britain you can be a supporter of the west indies , a supporter of manchester united , and a supporter of team gb .
