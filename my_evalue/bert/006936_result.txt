it’s 11 years since arsenal won the title . and you can throw bottlers into that description as well . arsene wenger 's gunners now have 15 wins from 17 games since new year 's day , but it 's come too late . this season for example , if they’d won a game they were winning at swansea , if they hadn’t been so desperately pathetic in the first half at stoke , and if they’d kept the lead at 10-man liverpool , arsenal would be top .
