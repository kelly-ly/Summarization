we returned to the city that never sleeps in january 2001 , eight months before the terrible events of 9/11 , and one of the first things my boyfriend sylvain longchambon and i did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the world trade center to see the monument to those who died . coronation street star samia ghadie and boyfriend sylvain longchambon take a selfie in new york . we valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area , and it came in really handy because during our stay sylvain 's cousin in new york celebrated his 30th birthday , so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly .
