( cnn ) i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up . it 's something that my husband and i just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the president of the united states . said `` shannon , '' also on twittter , `` i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but ... now i know she 's the kind of woman i hope i 've taught my daughters not to be . '' `` we went out to dinner in atlanta , and we had one too many glasses of wine , and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not , '' she said on `` good morning america . ''
