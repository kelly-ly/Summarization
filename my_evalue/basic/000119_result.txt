on tuesday , `` the late show with david letterman '' announced some of the guests for the talk show host 's final month of broadcasts . among the notables are oprah winfrey , with whom letterman has had an on-and-off faux feud for years ; clooney , who 's starring in `` tomorrowland , '' which will be released on may 22 ; and stern , who 's always an engaging letterman guest . but longtime fans may be even more intrigued by the appearances of keaton , an old acquaintance who once shared a stage with letterman as players on mary tyler moore 's short-lived 1978 variety show , and murray , who was the very first guest on letterman 's old nbc show , `` late night with david letterman .
