what would you get if one of the queen 's corgis ran off with one of sir ranulph fiennes 's siberian huskies and had a puppy ? a corgski , of course , just like max . he is , in fact , a fully grown husky-corgi cross . he 's become a favourite with workers at the dogs trust in basildon , essex , who have been looking after him since he was found .
