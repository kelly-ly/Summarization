humpback whale populations are to be declassified as ' endangered ' following a successful conservation programme . protection and restoration efforts have been taking place over the last 40 years after a dramatic reduction in humpback whale numbers . ‘it’s not so simple as drawing a line and saying : “ they belong to this population and there’s a lot of them so we are going to take them off the list” . ’ andy pool , head of the sea life trust , added : ‘ the sad fact is that , despite that ban , whales are still being hunted on our doorstep here in european waters and we need to do more to protect them and give whale populations here the opportunity to recover in the same way that these humpbacks have . ’ and carl chapman , from the norfolk cetacean recorder , told mailonline : ‘it’s important that we concentrate conservation efforts on populations that are still endangered , but i think a more caring society would still offer full protection to all living things .
