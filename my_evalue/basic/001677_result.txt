a vast underground network of pipes could be used to transport freight and deliveries in a bid to end road congestion and pollution . the plan , called the mole urban project , aims to reduce the level of road freight within urban areas by using freight pipelines carrying goods in capsules to edge of town consolidation centres , where they would be collected . the firm is now looking to see if the concept could be used within the town of northampton and if results are positive , a pilot could see underground pipelines installed to transport goods .
