it looks like something straight out of a hollywood movie , and on april 1st , most cynics may assume the research vessel flip is a poorly considered joke . the rv flip does not have its own engine and has to be towed to the location of scientific study , where it turns 90 degrees , leaving just 50 feet above the surface . after 20 minutes , the rv flip is safely positioned at 90 degrees allowing the researchers to begin their various experiments . it is used to measure underwater acoustics as well as water temperature .
