prague’s international airport has been forced to hire porters to carry passengers’ luggage up 32 stairs because a multi-million pound construction project didn’t budget for an escalator . a new metro line extension opened this week in the czech capital – transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before – but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses doesn’t have a moving staircase . that means porters are left to carry travellers’ heavy bags up and down the steep stairs at nadrazi veleslavin station , in north-west prague , from 5am to 10pm every day , free of charge .
