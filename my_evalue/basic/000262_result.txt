during the masters , spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries : mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation . tiger blamed a lack of glute ( primary buttock muscle ) firing for locking up his back , but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue . when golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips , they compensate with their low back and knees , which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury .
