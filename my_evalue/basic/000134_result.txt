i should have expected that dr. oz would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed `` quack treatments ... for personal financial gain . '' despite his utter humiliation , dr. oz soldiered on , with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him , and with harpo productions and sony , who co-produce `` the dr. oz show , '' fully behind his program . if the u.s. senate could n't bring him down , what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to columbia university , where dr. oz holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the department of surgery and performs his duties at columbia-affiliated new york presbyterian hospital ?
