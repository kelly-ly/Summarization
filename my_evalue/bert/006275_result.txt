chinese scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos for the first time . unlike other gene-silencing tools , the crispr system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level . the dna cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally , for instance after chronic sun exposure . when cellular machinery repairs the dna break , it removes a small snip of dna .
