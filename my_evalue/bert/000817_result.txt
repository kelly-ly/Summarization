kathmandu , nepal ( cnn ) we came on a commercial flight to kathmandu . it looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned . i do n't think they 're very concerned about looting , and there 's no military in the streets , but they will have to get water and food in the city soon . people have n't been able to get to outlying areas .
