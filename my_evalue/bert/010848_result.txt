a new mother who ' died ' for 11 minutes during her son 's birth woke up four days later with no memory of ever being pregnant or having her baby . i lost four fifths of my blood because they had n't finished the surgery on my c-section - i had to have a blood transfusion and was put on life support . ' mrs wilson said she burst into tears when she saw felix for the first time ( he is pictured in hospital ) . life is never going to be the same again - the day felix was born was like a re-birthday for me because it 's given me a whole new perspective .
