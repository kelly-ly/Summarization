these century-old photos offer a rare glimpse of some of beijingâ€™s most popular tourist attractions at a time when they barely had any foreign tourists and no one had ever heard of a selfie . a visitor stands alone at the temple of heaven , where emperors of the ming and qing dynasties held heaven worship ceremonies . today , these steps at the temple of heaven , a cluster of religious buildings in central beijing , are crowded with visitors . the quiet scenes are a far cry from modern-day beijing , which is one of the most populous cities in the world and visited by millions .
