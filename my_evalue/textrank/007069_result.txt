david cameron this morning launched a furious attack on labour mps ' bleating ' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year . â€˜ so when i hear labour politicians bleating on about the same old tories , not on the side of working people , i just think : some brass neck . mr cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment .
