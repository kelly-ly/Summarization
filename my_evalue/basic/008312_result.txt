i spoke to carl froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next . it wasn’t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of froch and chavez fighting in las vegas – a fight carl wanted . there is the possibility of paul smith-andre ward in the pipeline , anthony dirrell versus badou jack for the wbc world title and andre dirrell’s ibf world title fight against james degale , which is the biggest bout of this trio .
