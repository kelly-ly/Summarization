you might have seen fantastic images of the sun before , or even clips showing its activity - but you’ve never seen anything like this . another incredible part of the video shows ‘ coronal rain’ ( pictured ) streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun’s surface . coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun’s atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface . the video , though , is a reminder of just how beautiful , powerful and active our solar system’s only star can be .
