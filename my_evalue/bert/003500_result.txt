an explosive new report reveals that the united states began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the patriot act . in 1992 , a drug enforcement agency operation which has since been discontinued , monitored every telephone call made from the united states to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking , including almost every country in both north and south america . officials could not reveal those the program helped the agency to capture , but we do know that colombian barons carlos lehder , griselda blanco and daniel barrera barrera , also known as el loco , were all captured by or with the help of the dea in the years prior to the program . the scope of what the records could be used for was heavily checked prior to 9/11 , with all the data being used to investigate drug investigations , with the exception of a few incidents that were seen as potential threats to national security , like oklahoma city .
