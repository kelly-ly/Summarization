rarely can a headline in a matchday magazine have been so prophetic : on pages 16 and 17 of the united review , next to a picture of ander herrera , screamed the words ‘ right place , right time’ . it is no secret david moyes wanted to bring herrera to old trafford on deadline day in august 2013 but red tape scuppered his ambitions ; united pressed ahead with transfer after moyes was jettisoned but his inactivity prompted questions : did louis van gaal want him or rate him ? ander herrera , pictured with juan mata , netted a brace to ensure his side claimed the win against aston villa . i feel really lucky to be here .
