research led by a scientist at the new jersey institute of technology has revealed the first high-resolution footage of a solar flux ' rope ' taking shape on the sun , shown in this still image . a solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage , which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun . as common structures in the solar corona , they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather - including solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .
