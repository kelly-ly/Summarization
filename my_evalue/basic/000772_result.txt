after the westgate attack , al-shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in kenya that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of mpeketoni on june 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the quran on november 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing christian quarry laborers . in fact , thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of al-shabaab , which has steadily been losing ground for years in somalia as a result of the african union forces fighting them there , as well as a covert u.s. drone and special operations forces campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities . ground battles with african union forces have decimated al-shabaab 's rank-and-file , while u.s. drone strikes and special operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders .
