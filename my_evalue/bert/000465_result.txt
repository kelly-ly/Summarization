( cnn ) there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today 's jihadi fighters . women were not a big part of al qaeda 's immediate plans because al qaeda , unlike isis , viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal , one for future generations . isis and boko haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule , subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide , according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of afghanistan during the rule of the taliban , another radical islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women . and when it comes to women , the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision , one where some women say life is simply not worth living .
