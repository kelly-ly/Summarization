a didgeridoo maker demonstrated the power of music when he played a tune and caused a herd of cows to stand to attention . suddenly a cow steps out from behind the herd and with its ears lifted begins walking towards the river , which separates it from andrea . other cows lift their head from the ground and look in the direction of the sound , while another on the left also begins walking towards the river . the video concludes with an artistic shot of the cowsâ€™ reflection as the transfixed herd remain rooted to the spot , as if hypnotised by the sound of the didgeridoo .
