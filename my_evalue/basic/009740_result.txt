antoni van leeuwenhoek ( pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment . he took three lice , nestled them among the hairs of his calf , rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days . ‘ this spectacle of all the young lice filled me with such aversion to the stocking , ’ he wrote , ‘ that i threw it , along with all the lice in it , out the window .
