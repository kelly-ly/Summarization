a trespasser carrying a suspicious package jumped over the white house railings last night - the latest in a string of embarrassing security breaches to hit the us capital . last september , a knife-wielding man managed to scale the fence on the north side and get into white house itself via an unlocked door . he is currently under house arrest and faces up to four years in prison if he is found guilty of unlawfully operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national defence airspace .
