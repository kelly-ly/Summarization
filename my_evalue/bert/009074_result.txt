a blind man was left ' completely embarrassed and humiliated ' after staff at his local post office refused him entry with his guide dog . craig roberts , 36 , from chadderton , manchester , walked into his town 's post office and an employee shouted from behind the counter that he would have to leave his guide dog bruce outside if he wanted to be served . mr roberts said he has ' never experienced anything like this before ' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular post office has happened . it is totally unacceptable and they should have greater awareness .
