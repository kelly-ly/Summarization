bitten : austin hatfield , 18 , found the venomous water moccasin , also known as a cottonmouth , near his wimauma home last week ( pictured is hatfield with the snake that is believed to have bit him ) . alright he 's kissed it 12 times . right on the mouth . lucky for hatfield , antivenom does exist for cottonmouths -- known by the name because of the white , gaping mouth they often display when threatened .
