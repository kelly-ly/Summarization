( cnn ) american suburbanites who can do all their shopping without getting wet , driving from point-to-point or looking for a new place to park , can give much of the credit to alfred taubman . an army air force veteran of world war ii , he studied architecture at the university of michigan and lawrence institute of technology near detroit , and worked for an architectural firm , but decided that drawing was n't the path to success . in his autobiography , `` threshold resistance : the extraordinary career of a luxury retailing pioneer , '' taubman said that when he `` looked over the horizon , i saw that there was money to be made by people who could build and own stores or , better yet , groups of stores . '' and his influence stretched far from the american soil and into the thriving markets of china and south korea .
