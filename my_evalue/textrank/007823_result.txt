a texas highway was thrown into chaos on friday when the door of brinks armored truck flew open , causing money to spill onto the road . the passenger door of the truck somehow opened as it was moving causing a plastic bag with a ' substantial amount of money ' to be blown out . and as they started walking toward me the first guy i saw had a big wad of cash with money sticking out .
