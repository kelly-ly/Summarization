they may not be the most glamourous of scientific instruments , but tampons could help experts clean up polluted rivers . here , a discharge pipe dumps raw sewage into a river . lab trials determined that just five seconds exposure in a solution containing 0.01ml of detergent per litre of water - over 300 times more dilute than would be expected in a surface water pipe â€“ enabled a tampon to glow for 30 days . by using this technique at the opening of different pipes , they can trace the source of the sewage to certain households so that pipes dumping sewage into rivers can be redirected .
