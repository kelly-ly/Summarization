polls yesterday suggested the election will be too close to call – with the tories narrowly ahead in two , while another showed labour edging in front . labour were down one point on 32 per cent . mr silver said that even if the tories join forces with the lib dems – who he believes will win 27 seats – they would still be 13 short of the 323 mps needed for a majority . mr silver said labour , which has ruled out a formal coalition with the snp , would also be short of a majority even with the help of the scottish nationalists , who he predicted will gain 42 seats .
