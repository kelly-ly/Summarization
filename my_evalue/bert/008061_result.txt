they already have a fearsome reputation as the top predator of their time , but it seems the tyrannosaurs were also prone to eating each other . the researchers , whose work is published in the journal peerj , were examining the skull of a daspletosaurus found in a quarry in the dinosaur provincial park close to calgary , alberta in canada in 1994 . however , there are signs the bone had begun healing , suggesting the injury was not fatal and that the animal lived for some time after it was inflicted . while the researchers can not say what killed the daspletosaurus , damage on the jaw bones suggest that a large tyrannosaur bit into the dead creature between one and three times in what appears to be feeding behaviour .
