samantha says she thinks she 's ' fabulous ' . from my experience , most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than freely admit that not only are they good-looking , but they’re also ( whisper it ) beautiful . if women don’t fit in with their ( usually older , fatter , less attractive ) female peers , then those who are good-looking won’t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex ; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they’ll routinely receive their p45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile . we know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as instagram .
