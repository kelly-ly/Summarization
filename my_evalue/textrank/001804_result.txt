the study , based on satellite measurements between 1994 and 2012 by the european space agency , sheds new light on how antarctic ice responds to climate change . if the ice becomes too thin it would allow the permanent glaciers to slip into the ocean and start melting , sharply increasing the rise of ocean levels . a slight increase in ice thickness was observed in eastern antarctica before 2003 when rapid melting began , leading to an 18 percent reduction of thickness compared to 1994 . ' eighteen percent over the course of 18 years is really a substantial change , ' said fernando paolo , a researcher at the university of california , san diego . '
