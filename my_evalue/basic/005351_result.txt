it was all a far cry from iceland where i had begun my trip , courtesy of an icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of reykjavik and the spectacular golden circle for up to seven days en route to boston , anchorage , washington or , in my case , new york . although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009 , the icelandic capital shows signs of recovery – not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the apotek hotel , a gloriously scandinavian-looking place to stay , as i arrived at midnight following an evening flight from london . the next morning , after an all-american breakfast of bacon and waffles , i left the chintzy charms of the roger smith behind for a visit to moma , the epicentre of new york’s cultural cool .
