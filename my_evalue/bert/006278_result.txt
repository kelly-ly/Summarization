something odd is going on this year in goa - and it has to do with the rows of empty sunbeds . our seaside accommodation , with en-suite bathroom , is chic and tucked away in palm trees . on the beach , goans peddling pedicures and sarongs smile and tell us we are ' very pale ' , adding : ' you wo n't stay that way for long . ' goa has 11 hours of sunshine a day at this time of year .
