it 's been a frustrating few weeks but at our end we are trying everything we can to make the fight that everyone in this country wants to see â€“ scott quigg against carl frampton . both are former world champions and both are brilliant fights . i can tell you it is a fight that we are considering very closely . in november he won the british and commonwealth titles against bradley skeete and now his options look like a fight for the ibf international title against chris van heerden , an ibf title eliminator against timothy bradley , or a straight fight against the holder , who happens to be kell .
