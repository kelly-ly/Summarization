a real-life willy wonka has laid claim to making the most extravagant chocolate creation - a seven-foot-tall , five-foot-wide easter egg made using 352lbs ( 160kg ) of chocolate . the 58-year-old chocolatier commissioned an iron worker to make a special frame for his egg , which was then wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film , before being covered in chocolate . nothing tastes quite as good as easter egg chocolate and on easter sunday customers are going to take it apart and i 'm going to crack it with a big hammer .
