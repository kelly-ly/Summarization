the mobile x-ray scanner , heralded as the world’s first ‘ airplane scanner’ , sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside . while the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated , the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety . an operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane , although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted .
