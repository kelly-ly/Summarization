hitchcock was born in 1899 in leytonstone , east london , the son of a wholesale grocer . hitchcock was never any oil painting . his very first work , in 1927 , the lodger , was about a man wrongly accused of being jack the ripper and , already , hitchcock could whip up an atmosphere of ‘ doubt and suspense’ , the camera dwelling on ‘ dark puddles shimmering with opalescent light’ .
