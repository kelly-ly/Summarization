the chase , which took farmers and police officers from five jurisdictions through forests and over the hudson river , ended with `` snipers '' from the animals ' farm gunning down the buffalo from the side of the road , according to lt. thomas heffernan of the bethlehem police department . heffernan described the hectic last moments of the chase : `` they were setting up a perimeter around the animals in the secluded area , they got spooked and they charged through our guys , '' heffernan said . four men from gem farms in schodack , new york , from where the buffalo escaped , were on the scene by a ravine in coeymans , new york , to kill the animals , a decision heffernan said was n't made lightly , but that was necessary .
