following a torrid campaign with the team in 2014 , raikkonen finally has a car to his liking at ferrari this season , with the finn looking far more like his old competitive self . ferrari have proved more competitive in the first three races of this season than they were last year . we just need to be up there when something happens to them , or the conditions change , but i really feel on speed we will get there to regularly beat them . ' raikkonen recognises , though , he needs to do better in qualifying on saturday if he is to thrust himself into the hunt for the title .
