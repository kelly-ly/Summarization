these adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams . the dog brought another one in , but sadly that one had been shaken , so unfortunately it died within 24 hours . then lastly the third came in three weeks ago , that one 's from near cheddar in somerset , we called him scrumpy , because of the cider context . once they start to mouth things , they start playing with each other , pulling ears , scrumpy can get a bit rough though .
