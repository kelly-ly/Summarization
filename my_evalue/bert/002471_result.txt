a hat-trick of tries from teenage winger ash handley helped leeds to a handsome 41-16 win over reigning champions st helens that takes them six points clear at the top of super league . the 19-year-old handley got his big chance due to an injury to england winger tom briscoe and how he has seized it , with six tries in just six super league appearances . inspired by the never-say-die efforts of england hooker james roby , st helens produced their best spell of the match and pulled a try back in fortuitous circumstances when full-back tom makinson touched down jon wilkin 's kick when for all it looked like a knock-on and travis burns added the goal . that score suddenly brought the game to life but the rhinos struck a devastating blow to the champions deep into first-half stoppage time when a break out of defence by kallum watkins created the position for sutcliffe to gift-wrap a third try for handley courtesy of a pin-point kick to the corner .
