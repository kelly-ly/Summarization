uefa have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of england women 's u19 european championships qualifier against norway will be replayed after a refereeing mistake . norway are second in the group following an impressive 8-1 win against northern ireland , but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot-kick will give england a place in the european championship finals in israel . german referee kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on saturday . april 9 - northern ireland 1-8 norway .
