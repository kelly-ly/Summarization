scientists at a polish company that produce body armour systems are working to put a ' magic liquid ' that can harden on impact in their products . when hit by a high-speed projectile , a wide area of the stf hardens instantly , causing the usually massive energy to be dispersed away from the wearer 's internal organs . implementing the solution in body armor required designing special inserts , but the company says those are lighter than standard ballistic inserts and broader range of movement for their users in the police and military . ' according to the researchers , both liquids can find applications beyond body armor , such as in the production of professional sports inserts , and even entire outfits .
