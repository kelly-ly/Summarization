alastair cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor graham gooch but his technical problems very much remain . the step up to test level , however , has seen cook struggling and jerome taylor looked anything but mediocre in sending both him and trott back with just 20 on the board as england endured a rocky start to their second innings . earlier england had toiled before dismissing west indies for 295 , with the unlikely figure of james tredwell finishing with four for 47 but jimmy anderson only being able to claim one more victim to remain one short of sir ian bothamâ€™s england record of 383 test wickets . yet tredwell is reliable , steady and under-stated and england knew he would not let them down when they preferred him to the more naturally talented but inconsistent adil rashid for this first test .
