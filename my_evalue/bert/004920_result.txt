police believe they are on the verge of solving a brutal cold case murder that occurred 35 years ago . this after she and a friend had taken a ride home from a man ( above ) after school in rural hall , north carolina . more importantly , police can now test some of the dna evidence from the scene , something they could not do back in 1980 due to a lack of technology . the man was in his early twenties back in 1980 , drove a blue pickup truck ( similar to the one above ) with a white shell over the bed and went by jimmy , though he told the girls his friends called him butch .
