the city of eugene in the united states has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 iaaf world championships . the decision was taken by the international association of athletics federations council , who decided to bypass the usual bidding process because of what it saw as a ' unique strategic opportunity to host the iaaf world championships for the first time in the usa ' . eugene failed last november in its bid to host the 2019 event , which was instead awarded to doha , but a recent presentation to the iaaf persuaded the governing body the city has what it takes to stage a world championships .
