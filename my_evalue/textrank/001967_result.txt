austin is in contention because harry kane , who scored on his debut against lithuania last month and made his first start against italy in turin , will be with gareth southgateâ€™s under-21 team . the qpr striker will continue to be monitored by england head coach roy hodgson and assistant ray lewington ahead of the friendly with republic of ireland on june 7 and the euro 2016 qualifier in slovenia seven days later . hodgson has an established attack with wayne rooney , danny welbeck and daniel sturridge , when fit , but the unsuccessful trial of theo walcott up front in italy has forced them to look elsewhere .
