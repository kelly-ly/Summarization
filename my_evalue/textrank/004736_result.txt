dr robin allaby , a plant geneticist at the university of warwick who led the research , said : ' eight thousand years ago the people of mainland britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence , whilst at the same time in southern europeans farming was gradually spreading across europe . previous studies have shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments , so by looking at the ornaments , the experts were able to understand the spread of farming practices for the first time . they examined some 200 bead-type objects found at more than 400 european sites over a 3,000-year period , tracing the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to explain the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming .
