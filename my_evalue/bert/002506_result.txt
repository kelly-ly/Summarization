this garden gnome might not look like much but he is now worth £17,000 – with a little help from his friends . cardboard cutouts or waxworks of more than 60 celebrities including bob dylan and marlon brando were on the cover picture , which was the brainchild of artists peter blake and jann haworth and photographer michael cooper . following the shoot on march 30 , 1967 , mr cooper 's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by the band , who each signed it . the model has emerged for sale almost 50 years later .
