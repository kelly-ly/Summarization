while young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely , it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves . however , chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses . around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely . miss cibot , who worked on the study with dr sabrina krief , a lecturer at the national museum of natural history in paris and the great ape conservation project in uganda , said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe .
