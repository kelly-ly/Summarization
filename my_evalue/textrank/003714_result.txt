e-scapes is the world 's first ' virtual holiday ' experience on social media – allowing customers to appear to be on a trip away according to their social channels , whilst actually still at home . while e-scape customers are relaxing at home , their social media accounts - including facebook , twitter , instagram and snapchat – are updated to give the illusion they 're on a trip away . the mirage of being well-travelled on social media , is sometimes perceived more important than the travel experience itself .
