bournemouth moved four points clear at the top of the championship with a win against brighton as manager eddie howe set club records tumbling . they scored with their first shot on target in the 70th minute , well worth the wait when yann kermorgant hit a wonderful 25-yard free-kick which wrong-footed brighton goalkeeper david stockdale and flew into the left of goal . with only their second accurate effort , in the 81st minute , callum wilson extended their lead by running on to kermorgantâ€™s ball over the top and twice turned greg halford before finishing .
