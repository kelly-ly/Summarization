a recent report by the institution of engineering and technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars . however , many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans . meanwhile , trials will launch in another 12 to 20 us locations by the end of next year , which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 us cities by 2017 .
