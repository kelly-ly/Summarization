leeds showed they are in good shape to cope with kevin sinfield 's retirement as they claimed a 26-12 derby victory over castleford in front of a sell-out crowd at the mend-a-hose jungle . ryan hall was sent to the sin-bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but castleford failed to take advantage and it was the rhinos who struck first as joel moon scored his first try of the season . hall made amends by extending leeds ' lead and stevie ward 's converted try cancelled out michael shenton 's effort to give the rhinos a 16-6 half-time lead .
