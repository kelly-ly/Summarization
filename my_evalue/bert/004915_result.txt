' adams ( right ) decided not to fight after a burglary at her home , which occurred while she was in the house . we were looking forward to nicola taking part in the first ever england boxing championships in which the men and women 's finals are held as part of the same tournament , however it is completely understandable that nicola does not feel in any fit state to compete and we wish her all the very best in coming to terms with this upsetting incident .
