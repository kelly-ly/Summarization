when leaving a place of work , most people will usually avoid burning bridges . but one disgruntled staff member at an anonymous firm decided to skip the pleasantries and pen an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter announcing their impending departure to bosses . i am sorry i work 47.5 hours per week ( without getting paid the overtime that i am legally owed ) for the last 7 months , and thus have little choice but to schedule necessary doctor 's appointments during school hours . ' ' clearly i am a terrible employee , and for that i apologize .
