louis van gaal has found the best way to keep manchester united fans happy is to win at home . no wonder after a period of irritation earlier in the season , the stretford end are cheering regardless of whether united play quickly , slowly , pass back to goalkeeper david de gea or boot it up to marouane fellaini . i was afraid before this match because we were playing against a very defensive organisaton . benteke ( second left ) watches on as his tame shot proves too much for david de gea ( centre ) in the united goal .
