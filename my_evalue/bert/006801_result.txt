anything to declare . during his long career as a customs specialist at london airports , frost has had ‘ to politely listen to people lying through their teeth at you’ as they attempt to smuggle in snakes , bush meat ( zebra , lion , gorilla ) , combs that double as flick-knives , a monkey sewn into the lining of a coat , another monkey ‘ disguised as a hairy child’ , corpses ‘ propped up in a wheelchair wearing wonky sunglasses’ and a box of dry ice containing a man’s buttock , apparently sliced off by a samurai sword . what frost looks out for are people whose passports show frequent trips being made to drug-source countries . as coffins are ‘ a good vehicle for contraband importation’ , these have to be rigorously searched — a ghoulish task , especially if the deceased’s arm shoots up and its wig falls off .
