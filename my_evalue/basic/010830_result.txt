ed miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ‘blubbed’ while watching pride , a british film released last year . labour leader ed miliband confessed that he ' blubbed ' during the british film pride that centres on the 1984 miners ' strike . in truth , these movies — pride , billy elliot ( also a piece of miners’ strike propaganda that depicted thatcher as the devil incarnate ) , made in dagenham ( about a car factory strike ) and the full monty ( about a group of redundant sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money ) —might as well have been party political broadcasts for labour .
