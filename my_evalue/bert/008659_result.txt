liverpool intend to speak to jon flanagan about a new contract at the end of the season with the defender 's deal set to expire this summer . he has been back in training now for a while now but is thought to be some way away from being ready for first-team action - though he did play 31 minutes of the recent steven gerrard v jamie carragher all-star game at anfield . flanagan impressed so much last season that he forced his way into the england squad . both parties are confident an agreement can be reached and that the player can get his career back on track after a year to forget .
