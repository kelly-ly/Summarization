the afghan taliban has published a bizarre biography of their ' charismatic ' supreme leader mullah omar - praising the one-eyed terrorist 's ' special ' sense of humour and love of grenade launchers . the biography , posted just after midnight on the taliban 's main website , described mullah omar as being actively involved in ' jihadi activities ' , dispelling speculation that he died long ago . ' special sense of humour ' : in a clear attempt to counter the growing influence of isis in afghanistan , the taliban propaganda release lavished praise on the one-eyed extremist ( pictured left and right ) . it is the first time an afghan leader has confirmed isis involvement in the kidnappings .
