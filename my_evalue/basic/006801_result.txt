john frost says he ‘wouldn’t trust a nun with a crutch’ ( stock image ) . during his long career as a customs specialist at london airports , frost has had ‘ to politely listen to people lying through their teeth at you’ as they attempt to smuggle in snakes , bush meat ( zebra , lion , gorilla ) , combs that double as flick-knives , a monkey sewn into the lining of a coat , another monkey ‘ disguised as a hairy child’ , corpses ‘ propped up in a wheelchair wearing wonky sunglasses’ and a box of dry ice containing a man’s buttock , apparently sliced off by a samurai sword . as they riffle through travellers’ bags , frost and his team frequently detect drugs : socks impregnated with heroin , cannabis resin in shoes , soup cans or barrels of bitumen .
