motorists could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if labour gets into power , harriet harman has admitted . chancellor george osborne yesterday said the remarks showed labour would bring back the ‘ fuel duty escalator’ , which raised the levy by the level of inflation plus 1p per litre , scrapped by the coalition in 2011 . mr osborne’s announcement in the budget last month means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead .
