odds on the second royal baby being called sam have been slashed , following the success of sam waley-cohen at aintree , the duchess ' close friend . david williams of ladbrokes said : ' with sam waley-cohen 's close links to the royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with sam as their answer for the baby 's name . ' other reports suggest the due date could be april 25 . that date would tally with the fact that the duchess ' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on march 27 in south london , suggesting late april is more likely than mid-april .
