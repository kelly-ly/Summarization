manchester city will not compromise on quality in their search for homegrown players this summer . fa chairman greg dyke said it was ‘depressing’ to see city win the premier league with just two englishmen in their side last year and intends to introduce stricter rules on homegrown players from 2016 . but it would mean players , irrespective of nationality , will have to be with their club from 15 to qualify as homegrown ; the number of non-homegrown players in each 25-man squad is to be reduced from 17 to 13 and at least two homegrown players must be club-trained .
