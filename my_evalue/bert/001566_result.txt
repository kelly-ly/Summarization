these haunting images show the partially-submerged ruins of a church where a town was swallowed by an artificial lake 50 years ago . residents’ abandoned homes were inundated and destroyed when the settlement and surrounding area – including two other villages – in south-east bulgaria were submerged in 1965 . with rolling hills in the distance , aerial photos show vegetation growing on top of the church’s walls after the roof collapsed long ago . a segment of the cemetery is visible at times , depending on water levels in the reservoir , which is a popular fishing spot .
