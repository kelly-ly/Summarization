the duchess of cambridge is expected to give birth later this month , with a rumoured due date of april 25 . there is speculation the cambridges ' second born might arrive on the queen 's birthday on april 21 or even the duke and duchess ' fourth wedding anniversary on april 29 . that date would tally with the fact that the duchess ' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on march 27 in south london , suggesting late april is more likely than mid-april .
