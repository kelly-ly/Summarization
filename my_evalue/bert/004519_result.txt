a two-mile victorian railway line which was shut down 50 years ago under a programme of sweeping closures could reopen as britain 's longest cycle tunnel . the disused rhondda tunnel , which runs 1,000 feet beneath the welsh hills , was closed as part of the beeching cutbacks , a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in britain . the railway tunnel , which runs beneath the mountains under the dunraven forest in the south wales valleys , was opened in 1890 in the coal boom . the engineer had been employed to make the entire network more profitable , prompting him to recommend the closure of stations and railway lines which did not make money .
