pensioners aged over 75 will be guaranteed same-day appointments with their gp , as part of tory plans for a huge cash injection for the nhs . the move is designed to demolish cynical labour claims that the tories would ‘ cut the nhs to the bone’ and will mean ‘ at least’ an extra £8billion a year for the nhs by 2020 . mr cameron said the commitment to find the money would be included in next week’s conservative party manifesto . tory sources last night insisted the money could be found through efficiency savings and the proceeds of economic growth .
