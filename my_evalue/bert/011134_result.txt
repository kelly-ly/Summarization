this is the dramatic moment two typhoons came into land above an astonished father and son . the video was taken on the same day that typhoons were deployed by the royal air force as two russian long-range bear bombers , capable of carrying nuclear missiles , hugged british airspace . the 41-year-old said that he was ‘ as close to the action as you could get’ , having gone to the area after hearing on the news that nato exercises were taking place in the area . shortly after taking this video we were actually told we should probably move a bit away since the planes were coming in to land . ’
