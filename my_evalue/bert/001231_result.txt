britain 's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a £1million constable masterpiece that was looted by the nazis from its jewish owner during the second world war . it turned up in britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the tate in 1986 . the tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the nazis but the gallery’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported .
