forget fancy sheets and down-filled duvets , the perfect pillow is the key to a good nightâ€™s sleep . and while once our choice was limited to feather or fibre , the shops are now stuffed with everything from water pillows to scented pillows , and even one which is wired for sound . my husband , ray , likes a firmer pillow , while i like a lovely soft one , but i hate buying different types as we inevitably get them mixed up and we both have a bad night .
