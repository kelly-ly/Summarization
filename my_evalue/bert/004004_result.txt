if a golf course were to be created in hell it might resemble the now serene landscape of gallipoli , where the blood of thousands was spilled a century ago in one of world war i’s most spectacular allied failures . in addition to 11 rooms , with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of gallipoli . items of clothing worn in battle by mustafa kemal atatürk who commanded the turkish forces at gallipoli . you can look down on suvla bay 540m below , where british troops landed , and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug-outs in the footsteps of new zealand’s wellington battalion , before visiting the new zealand monument .
