this week saw the opening of centre pompidou malaga , the first of several popup versions of the famous parisian gallery planned outside france . pompidou is the latest bold step in branding malaga a ' city of museums ' . across town , the first overseas branch of st petersburg state russian museum has just opened in a refurbished tobacco factory . for unbeatable seafood , take the bus to the beach at pedregalejo on the city 's outskirts , where locals feast on freshly caught boquerones ( anchovies , often deep fried ) , espetos ( sardines , barbecued on sticks ) and platters of enormous mussels , prawns and clams . for modern minimalism , head to the sleek gastrobars of the arty soho district , such as kgb , where punky young things queue for tables .
