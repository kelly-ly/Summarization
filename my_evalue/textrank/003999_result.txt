incredibly , niamh found her match in karen branigan , 29 , a fellow ireland native who lives just an hour down the road , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . speaking to mailonline about her first meeting with karen , niamh said : i was ridiculously nervous about how i would react to meeting someone who looks like me . ' for the entire duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her . iâ€™m the weirdo that contacted karen out of the blue and asked her to meet me in person . ' since meeting , niamh and karen - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on facebook ' constantly ' .
