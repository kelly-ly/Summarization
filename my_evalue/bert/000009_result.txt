( cnn ) it 's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week 's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in panama : a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuban president raul castro . the summit hit a depressing low for the obama administration when chavez walked up to obama and , as the cameras clicked , handed the american president a copy of the book `` open veins of latin america , '' which blames the region 's woes on the u.s. unfortunately , in an effort to placate critics who say obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists , the white house has miscalculated with venezuela , handing the repressive regime of chavez 's successor , nicolas maduro , a stick with which to beat the u.s. but those days are behind us .
