packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of hmp altcourse in liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets . dave thompson , director of the category b prison , said : ' these items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops . ' altcourse , the first prison in the uk to be designed and constructed for a private operator , has been criticised for drug-related violence . g4s insists that altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation , and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility ' approach to show inmates they will ' root out packages from anywhere ' .
