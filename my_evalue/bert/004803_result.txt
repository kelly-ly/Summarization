a grandmother nicknamed the ' fairy dogmother ' spends more than £28,000 a year looking after the stray or abandoned dogs she has welcomed into her home . she then made it her mission to open her home to as many neglected dogs as she could , and last year had eight stray hounds brought over from romania and hungary at a cost of £350 per animal . they would have all these dogs hopped up on drugs and off their heads . but i do it because you see these sad cases and when you manage to turn it around it is so worth it .
