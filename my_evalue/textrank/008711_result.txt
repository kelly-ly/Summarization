it perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now no-one is further from the chop than the 44-year-old coach who took atletico madrid to the title last season and leads them into the champions league quarter-final against real madrid on tuesday night . this season atletico madrid are not going to win the league but no one is ruling out another tilt at the prize they were seconds from winning last season – leading from diego godin’s goal until the last minute when sergio ramos scored to take the match to extra time . atletico players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they didn’t give themselves much of a chance in la liga up against the stronger squads of real madrid and barcelona , they did fancy themselves in the champions league – ‘ we can beat anyone over two legs’ was the message and that still stands .
