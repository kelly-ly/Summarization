pfa chief executive gordon taylor has defended sterling for postponing contract negotiations . taylor said : ' i do n't think it 's meant to be a sign of disloyalty to liverpool . ' even steven gerrard , a liverpool man all his career , had to think about his situation from time to time when there was a great deal of interest in him from other clubs . ' as a player with two years left on his contract he 's obviously entitled to consider his options . ' they will want to focus on the run-in , the race for the top four and the champions league places , and the fa cup as well , and sometimes contract negotiations are the last thing you want to be worrying about . ' taylor added that he was confident sterling was aware of what he owed to liverpool and rodgers .
