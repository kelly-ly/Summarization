a newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men , the clip , which was created by hln 's the daily share , illustrates the prevalence of this ' women 's tax ' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences . that price could use a shave : the daily share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men 's and women 's versions . compounded with the fact that women make , on average , 78 cents on the dollar to men , the facts prove than gender bias is more than just offensive , it 's also very expensive . an even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle , where narciso rodriguez eau de toilettes for him and for her respectively cost $ 87 and $ 106.60 . meanwhile , a pair of neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $ 1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging .
