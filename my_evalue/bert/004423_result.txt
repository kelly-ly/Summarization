a first-of-its-kind 3d simulation has revealed what happens when two supermassive black holes dramatically collide in a disk . once merged , the material around the black holes continues to swirly intensely . this first simulation shows the gas and magnetic fields as the two supermassive black holes collide . each of the black holes found inside the quasar pso j334.2028+01.4075 has the mass of ten billion suns , and this simulation could provide an insight into what will happen if - or when - they merge . â€˜
