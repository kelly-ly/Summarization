hundreds of tourists had to be evacuated from warwick castle after a flaming cannonball set alight to a medieval thatched building during a display . holidaymakers , many with young children enjoying the last day of the easter break , had gathered to watch the cannonball be fired from the wooden trebuchet â€“ the largest working siege machine in the world . a flaming cannonball was launched from this wooden trebuchet , which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes , during a demonstration to show how the machine was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls . we 'd like to take this opportunity to thank warwickshire fire and rescue service for their prompt assistance .
