researchers subjected lithium-ion batteries to heat and used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe changes in their internal structure . li-ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway , which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost . during tests , one cell remained intact during battery failure and as the heat-generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the batteryâ€™s vent ( pictured left to right ) .
