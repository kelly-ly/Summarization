the biggest pension reforms in a century have been met with confusion as customers as young as 23 try to cash in their retirement savings . but one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings â€“ unaware they were three decades too young . others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once . but several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash , including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could ' get hold of their pot now ' .
