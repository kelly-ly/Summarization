the video above , recorded by researchers at the hebrew university of jerusalem , shows how that despite its body orientation ( green arrow ) the octopus can crawl in any direction ( blue arrow ) thanks to its flexible arms . the male dies soon after his unique ordeal , whereas the female can mate several times and even store multiple hectocotyli in a special cavity until theyâ€™re needed . the findings may help scientists develop new ways for soft robots to move around and can also shed some light on how octopuses evolved in the first place .
