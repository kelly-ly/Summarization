( cnn ) this week , social media heralded as # motheroftheyear toya graham , the baltimore single mom who pulled her son , who was holding a brick , away from the scene of a riot . a video of graham yanking young michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral . what i do see in graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents , mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence .
