the circuit itself has n't quite delivered many spectacular races , and you will be hard pressed to create a top five bahrain grand prix list . the scot would retire on race day with an engine problem after 50 laps - but he lasted 43 laps longer than team-mate kimi raikkonen who also suffered a mercedes failure inside his mclaren . health and safety folk would have a fit seeing scenes like this these days , as the renault team hang off the pit fence to congratulate fernando alonso on his win in the 2005 bahrain grand prix .
