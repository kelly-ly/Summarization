instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a ‘ super high-intensity’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes . illume arclighter replaces a traditional flame with a high intensity electric arc that focuses its energy at the tip . it focuses its heat at the tip so it won’t leave sooty marks behind .
