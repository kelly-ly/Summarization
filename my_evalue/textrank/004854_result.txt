unfortunately for brendan rodgers , things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season . with just seven games of the season left liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - raheem sterling , jordan henderson and steven gerrard - have scored six goals each . to put that into context , only crystal palace ( dwight gayle and mile jedinak - four ) and sunderland ( adam johnson and steven fletcher - four ) have top scorers with fewer premier league goals than liverpool . only sunderland and crystal palace have top scorers with fewer premier league goals than liverpool this season .
