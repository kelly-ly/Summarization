dawn was breaking as we pulled out of calvi station , and the town 's medieval citadel , perched on a headland , was bathed in the rosy glow of the first rays of sunlight . most of the trails were clearly marked with orange daubs of paint and i was equipped with maps and detailed instructions . after trekking through the beautiful spelunca gorge ( pictured ) , wendy took a cab to porto ( below ) . i was to see them close-up on my final hike along the cliffs to les roches rouges hotel in the village of piana .
