mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21-year-old jordan spieth took the first-day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun-baked 79th masters . whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant texan is another matter . given how good he was at 25 , he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable mcilroy will win the masters one day . over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner mickelson , but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th . â€˜
