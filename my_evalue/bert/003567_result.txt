british exports to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to the european union , official figures showed yesterday . it is the first time since records began that such sales of uk goods have outstripped those to the eu for six months in a row . previously they have beaten eu exports on a quarterly basis – or three months – but never for such a sustained period . but total sales of british goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a ' straitjacket ' on exporters .
