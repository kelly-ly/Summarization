one traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go , after he posted a picture online of him ' missing ' the top of the eiffel tower and asked users to help improve his photo . on a recent trip to paris , belgian food blogger yves van de ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich√©s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments . created images ranged from the comical , with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger , to the absurd , with van de ven imposed into michaelango 's creation of adam , reaching out towards the eiffel tower .
