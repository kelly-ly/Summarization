its firechat app paved the way for chatting to friends without the need for the web or even a mobile signal . called greenstone , the egg-shaped gadget acts like a beacon , or booster , to help messages move around these so-called wireless mesh networks more easily . instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal , the features lets users send messages to people in close proximity that are in bluetooth or wi-fi direct range - up to around 30 feet ( 9 metres ) . it does this by creating a localised network in which each phone becomes a node and the data is passed between nodes .
