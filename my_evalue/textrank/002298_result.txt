as both player and manager , he enjoyed a 27-year association with celtic football club . fittingly , the work on the statue will be carried out by john mckenna , the sculptor who recently completed the statue of jock stein which sits at the entrance to celtic park . work on the statue of mcneill will begin immediately and it is hoped that the completed work will be unveiled at celtic park later this year , around autumn . mcneill himself said : ' when peter contacted me regarding the statue i was completely taken by surprise . ' whenever i walk up the celtic way , i look on with a great sense of pride at the sight of brother walfrid , big jock and my old team-mate and friend jinky rightly taking their place almost as guardians of celtic park . ' every time i look back at this special club 's history and what we achieved it fills me with joy , and now to be told i am to be honoured beside these celtic greats , this really is a special day for me and all my family .
