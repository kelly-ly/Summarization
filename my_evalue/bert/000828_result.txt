( cnn ) the vii summit of the americas was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the united states and cuba . heads of state from 35 countries in the western hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic , social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994 . cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery , with some latin american leaders threatening not to attend the summit of the americas if the united states and canada did n't agree to invite president raul castro . while the world watches for the photo-op of obama and castro , it 's unclear if more latin american diplomats will side with maduro , and for america , the vii summit of the americas could go from `` mi casa es su casa '' to a walk into the lion 's den .
