cesar azpilicueta is counting down the games until chelsea win the barclays premier league title , and he thinks they have shown their strength by staying top of the table since ' day one ' . unsurprisingly , the 25-year-old spaniard - who has had two weeks off after not being selected for his national team - is pleased to have kept his place under new competition within the chelsea squad this season as they go in search of a league and capital one cup double . and obviously when i finish the game and i feel i have given everything and we win , i am happy .
