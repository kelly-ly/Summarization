rating : poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three-minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value . we unpack our whips ( sorry , wash bags ) before hurrying down to the shiny , funky bar and order two glasses of bubbly . the carpet is thick , the shiny bedhead and curtains so over the top they make us chuckle . cb7 4ey .
