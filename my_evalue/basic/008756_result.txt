when captain wayne rooney said after the draw in italy on tuesday that carrick was the ' best player on the pitch by a mile ' , and that he ' dictated the game ' he summed up what england have been missing since he signed for manchester united in 2006 . sir alex ferguson signed carrick for Â£18million , trusted him in midfield , and united dominated domestically and even became champions of europe in an era when guardiola , messi and barcelona were taking their place in history as one of the greatest ever club sides . that 's why i firmly believe that had michael carrick been a regular in england 's midfield for the past 10 years , we would have won a major tournament in that time .
