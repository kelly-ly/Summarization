a wicked mistake in the men 's college hockey title game on saturday by boston university 's goalie allowed providence to tie in the third period and paved the way for the friars to win their first title . the ncaa championship game , which ended 4-3 and was played at the td garden in boston , will always be remembered for the game-tying goal allowed by bu 's matt o’connor , not the winner . matt o’connor 's own-goal turned his team 's 3-2 lead into a 3-3 tie and led to their defeat in boston on saturday .
