los angeles ( cnn ) former rap mogul marion `` suge '' knight pleaded not guilty thursday to murder and all other charges related to a fatal hit-and-run incident in january in compton , california . his attorney asked the court to further reduce knight 's bail , now set at $ 10 million , but los angeles county judge ronald coen denied the request . in court testimony earlier this month , sloan , 51 , declined to identify knight as his attacker because sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends knight to prison , according to cnn affiliates kabc and ktla .
