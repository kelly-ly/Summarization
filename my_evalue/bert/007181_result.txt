taken at the dawn of photography , these unique pictures are some of the first ever taken of the city of bristol , nearly 100 years before much of its historic centre was destroyed by nazi bombing . other shots are almost identical , including the one of st john 's gate at the church of st john the baptist , which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the second world war . they are due to go up for auction in cirencester tomorrow . area of beauty : college green , bristol , as it looked in the 19th century .
