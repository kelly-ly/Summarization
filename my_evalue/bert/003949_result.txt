an adorable fox cub trapped in a garden fence was set free by a wildlife expert named simon cowell . despite the cub continuing to back away from the help , mr cowell manages to get hold of it and carefully lifts it out of the fence . choosing an appropriate location , the wildlife expert sends the fox on its way and tells it to go back to its mother . the cub then heads back home â€“ clumsily staggering over the branches and twigs around it while it wags its tail in obvious delight .
