snp leader nicola sturgeon , pictured today in kilmarnock , insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament , even though she is not even standing for election to the commons . ms sturgeon said that mr miliband will ' have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through ' . labour leader ed miliband , arriving at the arc arts centre in stockton-on-tees with local candidate louise baldock , said he had ' made it clear we 're not interested ' in deals , such as a ' confidence and supply ' arrangement where the snp would agree to back labour on important votes such as the budget .
