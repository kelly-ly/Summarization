a federal jury 's decision to convict dzhokhar tsarnaev of 30 charges related to the 2013 boston marathon bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes . the outcome of this first phase may have been preordained , but nearly two years after the bombing , the trial has held boston and the region in thrall â€” more so than i might have imagined . there is no death penalty in massachusetts , and in september 2013 , according to a globe poll , 57 % of respondents supported life in prison for tsarnaev ; just 33 % said he should be executed .
