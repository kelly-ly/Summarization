( cnn ) if newly revised nypd training materials are approved by a federal judge , new cadets could be taking courses reminding them `` not to engage in racial profiling . '' the training notes also instruct new cadets `` not to use terms or words that devalue groups of people or stereotype them '' and `` not to imitate speech patterns of other racial , ethnic and class groups when communicating cross culturally '' because `` they appear disingenuous , artificial , and possibly racist . '' the revised training notes , which include 140 pages of instruction and powerpoint slides , are a result of a 2013 federal ruling declaring the new york police department 's `` stop , question and frisk '' practice unconstitutional .
