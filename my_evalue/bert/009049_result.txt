sergio ramos was the first man carlo ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of real madrid’s dramatic champions league win over atletico madrid on wednesday . the two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night . he has filled in at left-back , can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker . and when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against bayern munich in 2010 in the champions league semi-final when he sent his kick – at least as far as twitter was concerned – into outer space , he has the guts to take another one in the european championship final a couple of months later , and not only score but dink it panenka style over the keeper’s dive .
