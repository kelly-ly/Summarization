friends of a british backpacker who drowned during a diving trip on the great barrier reef claim staff deleted photos that were taken shortly before the doomed young woman left the boat . the same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of ms farrell with others before the dive , but when they contacted wings diving adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted . at some point , the diving instructor lost sight of bethany , then realised he could not locate her , returned the other student to the surface , sought help and went back down , presumably with some other people to help . â€˜
