brendan rodgers has launched an impassioned defence of his abilities , insisting there is nobody better equipped to manage liverpool under the fenway sports group model . fsg , liverpool’s owners , maintain rodgers’ job is not even up for discussion but that has not stopped jurgen klopp – who will leave borussia dortmund at the end of the campaign – being mentioned as a possible successor . three months ago , i was a tactical genius . when i sit down and look at it , i will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they ( fsg ) want .
