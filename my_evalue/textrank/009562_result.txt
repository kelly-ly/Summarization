a researcher says a ' bone flute ' found in slovenia is not an instrument - instead , he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks . dr diedrich said analysis of the bone shows the holes are teeth marks , and the shape is just the result of the bone not breaking when it was chewed . the latest analysis says that many bones found in caves can simply be attributed to animals around 30,000 years ago , rather than neanderthals . shown is an exhibit of the life of a neanderthal family in a cave in the neanderthal museum in the northern town of krapina in croatia .
