a group of female fans , who 've dubbed themselves the ' milifans ' , are rallying support for the opposition leader on social media using the twitter hashtag # milifandom . the labour leader ( pictured in manchester yesterday ) has been the subject of a social media storm in recent days as a group of fans , mainly teenagers , have posted their affection for him under the # milifandom hashtag . perhaps fearing a gaffe , the labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the milifans but did tweet the teen behind it , @ twcuddleston , saying ' hi abby - delighted that you 've joined labour - welcome .
