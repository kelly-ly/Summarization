snp leader nicola sturgeon today hit back at claims from tory former prime minister sir john major that she poses a ' real and present danger ' to the uk . labour leader ed miliband accused the conservatives and david cameron of ' talking up ' the snp in the hope that the nationalists will win seats from labour north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 downing street . in a series of co-ordinated conservative attacks , david cameron warned a labour-snp deal would be a ' match made in hell ' for the british economy . however , just 22 per cent of voters across the uk back the idea of ms sturgeon playing a role in the uk government , with 54 per cent opposed .
