( chatto & windus £16.99 ) our fascination with aeroplanes , and the men who fly them ( it is still overwhelmingly men ) , has acquired a morbid flavour since germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the french alps by its troubled co-pilot andreas lubitz . there is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives . ’ before boarding , he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect , while they will tell him if there’s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster , and whether any of the ba staff on board have friends or family on the flight , people known , splendidly , as ‘klingons’ . unsurprisingly , life on a 747 is full of jargon : a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as ‘ the heavy’ , one acting as ‘ heavy out’ , the other as ‘ heavy home’ .
