manchester city boss manuel pellegrini says he is not impressed by manchester united 's rise up the table . ' city have lost five of their last seven games in all competitions and have not won away since mid-february . ' being a derby against a team like united that dominated the league for so many years , it 's more . ' at one time sir alex ferguson said the neighbours were disturbing them a little bit more , so i say that 's double motivation for us .
