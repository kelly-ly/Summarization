a japanese priest has vowed to crack down onto drink driving in the most cinematic way possible : dressing up as a superhero and patrolling the streets on his motorbike . bizarre images depict kumagai riding around kitakyushu in full kamen rider gear - which makes him appear like a giant grasshopper- and the trademark cyclone motorcycle , fitted with fake jets . unlike some superheros , kumagai has the full support of police and even dons an armband certifying him as an official drink-drive patrolman .
