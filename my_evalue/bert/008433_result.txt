sir bruce forsyth has spoken out in favour of assisted dying , saying that watching his first wife suffer with dementia has convinced him he wants to ' die with a bit of dignity left ' . sir bruce said his experience of nursing first wife penny calvert ( pictured here with the couple 's three children ) as she suffered with dementia had convinced him of a need for a change in the law . if it is what the person wants and it can be proved they are living a life of suffering it can be more cruel to do nothing . iâ€™d like that right for myself .
