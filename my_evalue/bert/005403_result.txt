from the moment i set foot on my terrace overlooking the scenic douro river to the divine meal i ate at its michelin-starred restaurant , the yeatman played a wonderful trick on me . the yeatman , portugal’s first luxury wine hotel , is built into a hill in vila nova de gaia , with all of its 82 rooms facing the river and almost every one themed after a portuguese winery . the restaurant at the yeatman is the only one in porto to carry a michelin star , offering exceptional service and creative dishes . i was treated to the spa’s signature massage - the caudalie relaxing massage , with grape extract oils - after spending some time in the relaxation room , which offers another impressive vantage point of the hustle and bustle across the river .
