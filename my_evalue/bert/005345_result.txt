the volkswagen westfalia camper is associated with the seventies , the summer of love and nature-loving hippies . speaking at the new york international auto show , dr neusser didn’t give any specific design details away , but said that the new version will share some features with the westfalia camper , because the placement of the motor and batteries will allow designers to borrow aspects of the original 1950s design . no images of the new vehicle have yet been released , but dr heinz-jakob neusser suggested that battery packs would be hidden under the floor in the vehicle and a small electric motor will drive its front wheels , making the new camper van more environmentally friendly than its predecessor ( an example is pictured ) . engineers are currently working on the concept car and dr neusser said that the design will go into production if it’s financially viable .
