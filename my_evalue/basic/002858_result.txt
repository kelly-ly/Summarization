a newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men , the clip , which was created by hln 's the daily share , illustrates the prevalence of this ' women 's tax ' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences . even more disappointing is that this practice of ' invisible tax ' is not only found almost everywhere , but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the us - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders . that price could use a shave : the daily share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men 's and women 's versions .
