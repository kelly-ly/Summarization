a rare bentley which has lain gathering dust for years has been bought for almost four times its estimated value - but still needs a full restoration . but when it is ready , it could be worth more than Â£1million - and would prove itself a wise investment for the anonymous british collector who bought it . it was considered the epitome of british luxury in the 1950s as well as being the first car to carry the continental nameplate . however , this white model is far from fast after spending the past 15 years gathering dust in a barn .
