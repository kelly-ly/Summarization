a new method known as ' crispr ' - helping scientists make accurate changes to dna - was used by genetics professor george church , who replaced parts of elephant dna with the mammoth genes . other researchers have proposed using mammoth dna to replace that of an elephant using a similar technique to the one used to clone dolly the sheep . the researchers , whose work is published in the journal cell biology , found that the mammoth genome only appeared to align with african elephant dna by between 64 per cent and 76 per cent .
