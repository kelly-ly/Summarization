a western gray whale has made the longest known migration by any mammal . the female , named varvara , swam 14,000 miles ( 22,500km ) from the east coast of russia to breeding grounds off the coast of mexico , and back , without even stopping for a snack when she was nine years old . if so , then the number of true western gray whales is even smaller than we previously thought . â€™ protecting the endangered western gray whales has been difficult , with five whales dying in japanese fishing nets within the last decade .
