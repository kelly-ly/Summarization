sydney-bound winger joe burgess scored his first super league hat-trick as wigan secured their first away win of the season , but they were made to work hard by struggling wakefield in an error-strewn game at the rapid solicitors stadium . burgess , who is joining sydney roosters at the end of the year , scored three of the warriors ' seven tries in a 40-22 victory - their first super league success in west yorkshire for 18 months - to help his side climb above st helens into second place in the table , at least for 24 hours . yet the wildcats made the best possible start , with makeshift centre matt ryan breaking clear from his own half to create a try for full-back craig hall , who kicked the first of his three goals . wigan looked to have gained control , however , when prop dom crosby took michael mcilorum 's pass to crash over for his first try for more than two years and scrum-half matty smith skipped through wildcats defence for a solo score .
