a football fan has triggered a furious row after posting a picture of two muslim men praying at a premier league stadium and labelling it a ‘disgrace’ . fury : stephen dodd took this photograph of asif bodi and abubakar bhula praying at anfield last month . mr dodd’s post , made after liverpool took on blackburn rovers in the fa cup last month , was met with widespread condemnation on social media , with users branding him a ‘bigot’ and ‘ disgrace to humanity’ . maybe the man who took the photo has not come across muslims before who have explained the significance of prayer .
