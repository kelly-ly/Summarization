all eyes will be on ap mccoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but i have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him . he has ridden him three times before . shutthefrontdoor , the 2014 irish national winner , is also strong on that score . i like last yearâ€™s runner-up balthazar king and 2014 scottish national winner al co , as well as godsmejudge , second in that race having won it in 2013 .
