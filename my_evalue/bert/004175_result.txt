ed miliband faced ridicule last night after privately billing himself as the ‘ happy warrior’ ahead of last week’s televised election debate . embarrassingly for the labour leader , the ten pages of notes were apparently left behind in the salford itv studios where mr miliband clashed with david cameron , nick clegg and four other party leaders . but his discarded notes , according to the sun on sunday , reveal the extraordinary lengths he went to in his determined bid to get the better of his political opponents . in a further self-motivational message , mr miliband , pictured during the debate as natalie bennet speaks , also wrote the words ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ connected by an arrow .
