we were both pushing a buggy with a tiny baby inside : me , my son ben , now four , who was born when i was 73 ; peter , his daughter rosabella , who arrived when he was 72 . donald trelford ( left ) had his son ben ( back right ) when he was 73 and his daughter poppy ( held by donald ) when he was 76-years-old . donald ( pictured with ben and poppy ) says the physical effort of coping with young children at his age can be demanding but he takes daily walks and uses an exercise bike to keep fit .
