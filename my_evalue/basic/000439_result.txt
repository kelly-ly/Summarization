( cnn ) i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up . let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time , whether it 's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant . said `` shannon , '' also on twittter , `` i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but ... now i know she 's the kind of woman i hope i 've taught my daughters not to be .
