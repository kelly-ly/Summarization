despite an 18-hour journey on the flawless singapore airlines , i arrived in phuket still excited about recapturing my zen . phuket , however , is very different from koh phangan . the landscaped gardens are supposedly ‘edible’ , there’s a space for some of the happiest free-range chickens i’ve ever seen , and a mushroom hut , where the chef harvests fresh oyster mushrooms .
