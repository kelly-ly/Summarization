it is legendary now that when the spanish national team was coming to the boil and about to scald world football for six years , la roja 's own fans did n't even know the water was hot . because they left spanish soil having eked out two single-goal wins , over peru and the usa , the booing , whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win euro 2008 . of that starting line-up only de gea has n't played uefa football this season , eight of them are still in the champions league quarter-finals while two of the substitutes , nacho and dani carvajal have decent minutes in the competition .
