officer michael rapiejko was with the new york police department from 2003 to 2006 . rapiejko 's actions in marana , arizona , in which he drove his patrol car into a man who had fired a rifle in the air minutes earlier and before that had pointed the gun at another officer , have stirred debate about what type of force police should have used . marana police on thursday told cnn 's miguel marquez that a store gun lock was still on the rifle when it was recovered .
