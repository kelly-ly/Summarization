a man has been arrested and bailed following the ' suspicious ' death of a woman found floating in the water at a boat club - just hours after a children 's easter egg hunt took place in the grounds . the boat club has space for 130 boats on individual moorings , which stretch around a third of a mile along the bank of the canal . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .
