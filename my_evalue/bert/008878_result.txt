foreign gps now account for 11 per cent of family doctors , new figure show . senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the nhs is so short of homegrown medics . the figures do not state where the foreign gps trained but separate data from the general medical council shows many are from india , pakistan , south africa and nigeria . the nhs should train more staff rather than spending Â£2.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses , a think-tank has suggested .
