two black candidates were among three people elected to the ferguson city council tuesday , tripling african-american representation in the st. louis suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the august shooting death of an 18-year-old black by a white police officer . the election means that half of the six-member city council in ferguson , a town where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black , will now be african-american . the election came just over a month after a justice department report detailed a culture of racism and abuse among city officials , employees and police .
