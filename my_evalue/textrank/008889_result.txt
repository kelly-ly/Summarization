we all know the time-consuming hassle of having to hoover the house , so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this russian aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks . debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines , so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck , but the crew of the kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects , using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up .
