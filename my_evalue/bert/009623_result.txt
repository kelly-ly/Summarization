tottenham defender ben davies will allow no room for sentiment up against wales team-mate sam vokes at burnley on sunday . i have played alongside sam with wales for a good couple of years now and it is always strange coming up against somebody who is normally a team-mate , but regardless of that burnley is a tough place to go , ' davies said on tottenham 's official website . ' it is going to be no different on sunday . they are all fit and at a very good level too . '
