the bbc is to air a two-hour , real-time documentary following a canalboat as it pootles its way along a british waterway at a leisurely 4mph . there is no presenter , narrator , dialogue or music , so all viewers will hear are the sounds of the boat 's engine , the lapping of the water and the local birdsong as the barge makes its way along a picturesque stretch of the kennet and avon canal . aside from two aerial cutaway shots , when the boat negotiates a lock and crosses the dundas aqueduct , the full two hours is shot continuously from a single camera on the front of the boat .
