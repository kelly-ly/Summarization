small businesses and restaurants will be forced to close over the easter long weekend as they struggle to cover the costs of penalty rates on public holidays . we 'd like to give local people jobs . customers lose because the services they want are harder to access ; staff lose because they do n't get the hours many are seeking at work ; and business proprietors lose because they get little benefit from the holiday traffic . ' the campaign will also allow businesses that remain open over the public holidays the option to display a sign in their windows to explain why they are operating with reduced staff . '
