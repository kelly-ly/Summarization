little things like using a fork , going out at night , tucking into bed without anyone checking on you ; they 're all strange for someone like hinton who spent nearly 30 years on alabama 's death row . until one week ago , when his murder convictions were wiped clean , and hinton walked out of a county jail in birmingham . hinton had to get used to much worse . and life in the outside world passed him by : hinton said his hardest day came in 2002 , when he learned his mother had died . hinton was convicted of killing two men -- birmingham-area fast-food restaurant managers john davidson and thomas wayne vason -- but he always said he was innocent . alabama inmate freed after 30 years on death row .
