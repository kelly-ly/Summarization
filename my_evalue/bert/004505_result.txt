i felt as if i was treading on hallowed ground . there are few signs of habitation in this pristine wilderness , with only a few roads linking the small communities . kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population , so one morning i set off in search of them with retired ranger brent liddle and his dog blue . clapping hands to warn of our presence , we scrambled along a rocky path , stepping over tangled roots and clambering over fallen logs .
