children as young as three are being asked to sign a contract pledging not to use transphobic language at school . this is achieved when all staff , parents and children understand their responsibilities and work together towards the same goals , as detailed in our home-school agreement . ’ in a list of responsibilities for pupils to sign is a clause which states pupils will be tolerant of ‘ sexual orientation or lifestyle and refrain from using racist or homophobic or transphobic language in school’ . it was introduced last year in response to the trojan horse scandal , which saw schools in birmingham allegedly infiltrated by muslim hardliners hoping to impose an islamic agenda .
