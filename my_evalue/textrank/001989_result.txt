his behaviour was so obvious that it had attracted the attention of undercover police officers who were watching his every move . he was convicted of sexual assault after a two-day trial at the old bailey , but the judge decided not to jail tahir in the hope that he can tackle his problems under the supervision of probation officers - despite saying ' there must be a custodial sentence ' . so blatant was your conduct that no less than three undercover police officers saw you doing it and saw you looking at young women .
