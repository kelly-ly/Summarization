scientists have long known that sleep , memory and learning are deeply connected . in other words , is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet , allowing memory neurons to go to work , or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep ? then , after a while , the dpm neurons start signaling to suppress that section , as if to say , `` you 're going to need sleep if you want to remember this later '' . ' understanding how sleep and memory are connected in a simple system , like fruit flies , can help scientists unravel the secrets of the human brain . ' knowing that sleep and memory overlap in the fly brain can allow researchers to narrow their search in humans , ' ms christmann said . '
