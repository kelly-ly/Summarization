it is frustrating knowing we do n't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace . going into a race , knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage , is not the easiest for a driver . ' at the moment , on pure pace , it is quite difficult to make it into the points . we 're going to give 100 per cent and try to be there with whatever we have , to try to get into the points before we get the new package that can hopefully get us back into the points on pure pace .
