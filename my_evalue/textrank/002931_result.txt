the health reforms , which include fining agencies employing models with a bmi under 18 and criminalising pro-anorexia web content , have now passed through the upper house of parliament . an analysis of the reforms by sarah jackson , a research psychologist at university college london , suggested that censoring images of ultra-thin models may ease their adverse effects on young women , such as concerns about body image and behaviours such as unhealthy eating . research mentioned by ms jackson did find that women evaluated their bodies more negatively after viewing images of thin models .
