john carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of newcastle united with thousands of supporters planning to boycott sunday 's home match against spurs . results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped carver’s cause , but the problems at newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad . so obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come , and i respect that . ’ carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against tottenham hotspur .
