four years after the 2011 revolution that saw colonel gaddafi 's hold on libya crumbled , the once feared bab al-aziziya compound , situated in the capital city of tripoli , resembles a wasteland . colonel muammar gaddafi stands with his wife and children near bab al-azizia palace in november 1986 , before it was left in ruins by air raids . all that remains of the palace , which had been hit in a 1986 us air strike before being pounded by nato four years ago , are a few ruined buildings , the green flooring of gaddafi 's home and a dug-up network of underground tunnels .
