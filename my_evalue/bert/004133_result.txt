josh warrington admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against dennis tubieron as he eased to a lop-sided points win in leeds . it was good to get 12 rounds . after an even fourth , tubieron stepped on the accelerator in the fifth before warrington fought back . if there has been a criticism of warrington 's career to date it is that he lacks the power needed at the top level and despite throwing everything at tubieron , the filipino was still standing at the start of the penultimate round .
