graeme mcdowell admits he has sometimes needed to spend time in a padded room after failing to get to grips with the challenges posed by augusta national . i was out there just picking up little nuances that i have n't perhaps noticed before and putting those in the memory bank and trying to apply your knowledge and experience and hope that some year i can come here and really compete . i am really focusing hard on my chipping and putting this year . sometimes i have required a padded cell when i 've walked off the 18th green because i have got frustrated , but i have learned to understand why the course frustrates you , because it makes you play with the handbrake on .
