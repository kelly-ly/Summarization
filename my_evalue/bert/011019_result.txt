it 's all pep guardiola 's fault ; him and the good folk of scotland or , at least , st andrews . something happened back in 2008 when guardiola took over at barcelona and it was n't that the barcelona team changed . between 2005-2009 the premier league provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the champions league ; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24 . rafael benitez was an extraordinary force , the diego simeone of that era , regularly out-witting mourinho and taking a relatively normal liverpool team to two finals .
