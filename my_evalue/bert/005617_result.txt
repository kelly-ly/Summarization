from the sky it appears to be an idyllic island with amazing beaches and a dense forest , but tourists or fishermen don’t dare to set foot on this outcrop in the indian ocean due to its inhabitants’ fearsome reputation . to protect the sentinelese people - and visitors - the indian government has established a three-mile exclusion zone . often referred to as a ‘ stone age tribe’ – a title that advocates take offence to , as its members have adapted over time – the sentinelese may be the most isolated tribe in the world , with the indian government choosing not to meddle in their affairs . in the late 1980s and early 1990s several tribespeople were killed in battles with armed salvagers who visited the island to recover iron and other goods from a shipwreck .
