' in the us , we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme . ' for the vast majority of responsible dog owners this should pose no problem at all . ' in fact , we believe that the minimal cost involved in the dna testing will pose value for money when the selfish minority of dog owners are brought to task . '
