after years of suffering behind its barbed wire fences , watching those they loved waste away before their eyes while nazi guards systematically slaughtered them by the tens of thousands - this is the moment the inmates of bergen-belsen watched as the death camp was burned to the ground . shortly after the camp was liberated by british and canadian troops in 1945 , it was torched , and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings , along with the reichskriegs flag and hitler portrait which adorned them , were consumed by flames . infamous : this is the bergen-belsen concentration camp in germany as it appeared in the days after it was liberated by british and canadian troops , adorned with the german reichskriegs flag ( left ) and a portrait of hitler ( right ) .
