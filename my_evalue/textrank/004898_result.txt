david cameron said in his speech to the conservative party conference last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax – currently £10,600 – go up to £12,500 by april 2020 . this will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether , while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth £500 a year . tax cuts for the low paid are a priority for the prime minister after promising to raise the inheritance tax threshold and the 40p rate of tax for those on higher incomes .
