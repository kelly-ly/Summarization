michael carrick 's outstanding second-half performance for england against italy on tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the three lions behind sir stanley matthews . carrick made his england debut against mexico in may 2001 as a teenager with west ham united and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to euro 2016 , he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary sir stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years . carrick has played for england for 13 years , 310 days - while sir stanley matthews reached 22 years , 228 days .
