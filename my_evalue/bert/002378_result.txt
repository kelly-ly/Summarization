in a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young english talent in the premier league , it’s good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season . tottenham defender eric dier ( left ) has grown in stature as the season has progressed at white hart lane . he was a powerful , quick right back who charged up and down , but he needed more control . and if roy hodgson wants to fit more attacking players into his england side in the future , there’s no reason why this trio , with their experiences at full back , couldn’t play together in a back three .
