prince george 's birth in 2013 sparked a £247m sales bonanza for makers of royal memorabilia but experts say the second royal baby is unlikely to have the same effect . however , the baby is expected to make more of an impact in the long term - especially if the child turns out to be a girl . although no official memorabilia is planned , the highgrove shop , which turns over its profits to the prince of wales’s charitable foundation , already sells organic baby balm for £24.95 , a highgrove baby bear for £34.95 and a “ happy and glorious” baby blanket , featuring guards in red tunics and bearskin hats , priced at £94.95 .
