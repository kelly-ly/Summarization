a company has released matches that continue to burn even when submerged in water or buried underground in dirt . the uco stormproof matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them and will start burning again once they come into contact with oxygen . they can also keep smouldering even while underwater . the makers explained that essentially , the match stick is n't burning , it is the coating on the stick that is alight : ' we have drenched them in buckets , buried them in mud , and blown them with a compressed air hose ' .
