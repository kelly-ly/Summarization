it may sound like the stuff of science fiction , but this stunning image shows that a white dwarf star ripped apart a planet as it came too close . this means that , for close encounters , the gravitational pull of the star and the associated tides , caused by the difference in gravity 's pull on the near and far side of the planet , are greatly enhanced . chandra 's excellent x-ray vision enabled the astronomers to determine that the x-rays from ngc 6388 were not coming from the putative black hole at the center of the cluster , but instead from a location slightly off to one side . the planetary debris is then heated and glows in x-rays as it falls onto the white dwarf .
