a commuter is fighting for his life after reportedly bending down to pick up his bag and being hit on the head by a rush-hour tube train as it pulled into a station . i was standing only maybe five metres away and he was hit by the front of the train as it came into the platform . someone who i believe was on the platform was checking for a pulse . we are investigating the incident to understand exactly what happened but we have already established that while the station was busy , the platform was not overcrowded .
