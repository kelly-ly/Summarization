so when the incas needed to travel across the andes , they did so on handwoven rope bridges , stretched over gorges and rivers . as they expanded their empire , the incas built an entire network of bridges to move armies , people and goods quickly and efficiently over the mountains . even though it would take another 300 years before suspension bridges came to europe , it is estimated that the inca kingdom was connected by some 200 , all made by hand .
