england have a good spinner in moeen ali - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back-up in joe root . ben stokes was the pick of the bowlers for me on day one because of the fuller length that he bowled . ben stokes , the pick of england 's bowlers on day one , athletically fields a shot from his own bowling .
