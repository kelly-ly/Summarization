an explorer who plans to spend a year living inside a ball-shaped capsule on top of an iceberg is seeking funding for his daring project . the capsule will be 10ft ( three metres ) wide and could fit 10 people - but mr bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one , for himself . comparable feats of endurance , such as the solar impulse mission , have also seen people remain in isolation for days , but mr bellini will have to cope for a whole 365 by himself . mr belliniâ€™s plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but , if the iceberg were to flip , he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air .
