ceglia 's father told broderick at a hearing last week that he believed his son might have fled because he believed facebook and zuckerberg were working together with prosecutors against him , jeopardizing his chance for a fair trial . prosecutors said a forensic analysis of his computers and harvard 's email archive determined ceglia had altered an unrelated software development contract he signed with zuckerberg in 2003 and falsified emails to make it appear zuckerberg had promised him a half-share of facebook . zuckerberg has said he did n't come up with the idea for facebook until months after he responded to ceglia 's online help-wanted ad and signed a contract agreeing to create some software for him .
