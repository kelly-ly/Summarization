an oxford college and a retired architect are embroiled in an absurd row over a stretch of scrubby bushes which are quickly becoming ' the most expensive hedge in warwickshire ' . the bizarre dispute began when anthony bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge , which marks the boundary between his home and the college 's land . both mr bethell and st john 's college have spent £80,000 in legal fees in total , with the cost of a full trial likely to set the parties back £150,000 . the huge sum led the judge overseeing the pre-trial hearing at coventry crown court to suggest the bushes are quickly becoming ' the most expensive hedge in warwickshire ' .
