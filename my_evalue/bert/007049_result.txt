jb holmes took victory in a play-off at the shell houston open when johnson wagner saw a four-foot putt lip out . spieth still had the chance to win it outright but found a bunker , and he needed a fine 42ft chip and then a 12ft putt to rescue par and join the play-off . he would be eliminated with a bogey . i went there monday and tuesday and saw the course so hopefully i 'm ready .
