as australian fashion week comes to a close , a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in australia and their companies , for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers . a mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum , and even then , only for part of their supply chain , ' the report states . ' we found all the public information available on the companies - public statements , anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed . however the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like kmart and cotton on improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers , and h & m , zara , country road and the sussan group showing attempts to improve their international worker 's pay .
