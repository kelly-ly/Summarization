cycling anywhere with a toddler in tow means having to leave the buggy at home . a child , up to a height of 3.2ft ( 1 metres ) , is then strapped into the seat in an almost vertical position . the parent cycles to their destination , and once they arrive , can unclip the seat and push it like a regular buggy . the firm 's website describes p√•hoj as being ' lightweight ' but did not provide any further weight information .
