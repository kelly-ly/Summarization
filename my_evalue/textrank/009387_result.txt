the sun sets over dozens of abandoned cars in 2014 in colorado . while in many cases i can not retrace the history of the vessels , some sites are more discernible and conspicuous than others .

' some friends got really angry when they saw , for instance , an extraordinary jaguar xk120 left alone on purpose . ' in restored condition this car could fetch $ 120,000 ( Â£82,000 ) . ' dozens of cars lining forest a pathway in france appear to be sinking into the mud .
