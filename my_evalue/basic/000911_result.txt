kabul , afghanistan ( cnn ) it is a strangely detached scene for the close of america 's longest war : military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar , high security bases , on black hawks , miles from the front line . we are near jalalabad , at a regional logistics hub for the afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms , ammunition , even fuel for vehicles . u.s. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need .
