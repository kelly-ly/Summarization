nigel farage suffered a fresh blow today after a poll of key marginal seats revealed voters were deserting ukip in droves and returning to labour and the tories . he is now sitting in second place in the kent constituency , 1 per cent below his conservative rival craig mackinlay and only just ahead of labour . his business has been badly hit and the quota , which has been blamed for bringing the industry in north devon to the brink of collapse when skate and ray fishing was halted in october .
