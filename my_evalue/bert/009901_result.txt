nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light-years away , making it one of the most distant planets ever found . known as 'ogle-2014-blg-0124lb , ' the gas giant was detected by the spitzer space telescope and the ogle warsaw telescope in chile . when spitzer watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on earth , it sees the star brighten at a different time , due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points . knowing the distance allowed the scientists also to determine the mass of the planet , which is about half that of jupiter .
