he later said : ‘ i was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day , which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low . he added : ‘it’s amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers . ’ according to wpbf 25 news , the plane’s pilot , chris georgaklis , 85 , managed to fly 100 miles to fort lauderdale after the incident and landed safely . the most common cause of a gear-up landing , also known as a belly landing or pancake landing , is human error – when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown .
