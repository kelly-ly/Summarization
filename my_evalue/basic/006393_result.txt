manchester city manager manuel pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first-team squad , hinting that city may look to cherry-pick the best youngsters from their top-flight rivals . in the week that liverpool’s raheem sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at anfield , pellegrini’s comments suggest that city may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer . but the lack of suitable candidates emerging from patrick vieira’s academy means city’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota , with the defending league champions also linked with arsenal’s jack wilshere and ross barkley of everton .
