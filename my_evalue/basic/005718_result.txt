now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane – a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide . the center for arctic gas hydrate , climate and environment ( cage ) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor . scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane – a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide .
