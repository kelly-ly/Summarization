i 've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time , that 's fine . hopefully that 's it and , although it happened , the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better . ' they have done really well and had two good results against us , but if we play queen of the south and hibs - or just hibs - they will be tough games .
