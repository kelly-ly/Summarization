it 's not something parking wardens are usually accused of ... but some have been criticised for being too nice . inspectors in welshpool and llandrindod wells have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements ( file picture ) . they said wardens are currently leaving it ‘ too long’ , particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time . some 5,000 tickets are issued in powys , bringing in £1.2million a year , but the council is still subsidising the operation .
