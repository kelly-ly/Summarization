the way we introduce the calicivirus in rabbit populations is first we chop regular carrots up and distribute them to different areas and see if they are going to eat them . ' then , the virus is produced in a laboratory with spreading agents and its mixed with carrots - so that it 's coating the carrots - and then we take them and give them to councils to put out where they want . ' while rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving , about 70-100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus , also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease ( rhd ) , which damages the animal 's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding . it 's important that people who own pet rabbits vaccinate for calicivirus now to ensure that if their domestic rabbit comes in contact with the virus , which is mainly spread by contact between other rabbits and insects , they are immune .
