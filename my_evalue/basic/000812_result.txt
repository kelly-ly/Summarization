hillary clinton 's online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be . still , on balance , clinton 's tenure at the state department should be a real advantage during the campaign , particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective republican rivals . clinton will face a harder balancing act : how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in obama 's first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak , vacillating and fairly or not , responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse , especially in the middle east and with russia , than when president obama took office .
