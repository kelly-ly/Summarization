swansea ( 4-3-3 ) : fabianski 6.5 ; naughton 6 ( rangel 56 , 6 ) , fernandez 6.5 , williams 7 , taylor 7 ; ki 7 , cork 6.5 ( dyer 65 , 6 ) , shelvey 6.5 ( grimes 90 ) ; sigurdsson 6.5 , gomis 7.5 , routledge 6.5 . hull ( 3-5-2 ) : mcgregor 5.5 ; dawson 5.5 , bruce 6 ( diame 70 , 6 ) , mcshane 6.5 ; elmohamady 6 , ramirez 5.5 ( quinn 30 , 6 ) , livermore 6 , meyler 5 , brady 6 ; n'doye 5 , hernandez 4.5 ( aluko 81 ) . true , they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – bafetimbi gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and david meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match .
