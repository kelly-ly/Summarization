thinking about vacating the white house probably is n't president obama 's favorite thing to do , but it is n't his impending departure that stresses him the most - it 's the prospect of his eldest daughter leaving 1600 pennsylvania avenue and heading off to college that really gets him down . ca n't let her go : the 11th grade student ( left ) is already visiting schools and will go to college in the fall of 2016 . thankfully : malia 's ( right ) younger sister sasha , 13 ( center ) , wo n't start thinking about college for a few years yet . however , based on comments he made in february when he addressed a cybersecurity summit on stanford 's campus in palo alto , california , president obama might want his daughter to go there .
