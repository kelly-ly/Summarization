washington ( cnn ) in a broad bipartisan vote , the senate on tuesday gave final approval to a medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the `` doc fix , '' a method the government has used to ensure payments to medicare providers will keep up with inflation . `` tonight , the senate is voting to retire the outdated , inefficiency-rewarding , common sense-defying medicare reimbursement system , '' said sen. ron wyden of oregon , the top democrat on the finance committee just before the final vote . `` unless the senate passes the house-passed ' doc fix , ' significant cuts to physicians ' payments will begin tomorrow , '' boehner said .
