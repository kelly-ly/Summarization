brentford are considering appointing gianfranco zola as their new manager at the end of this season . current boss mark warburton is to leave the club next month after feeling his vision did not match that of brentford , who are to implement a continental approach to their management structure . zola was sacked by cagliari last month after failing to win a game during his three-month stint in charge . but the former watford head coach does have extensive experience of managing in england and would buy into the european way to start in west london .
