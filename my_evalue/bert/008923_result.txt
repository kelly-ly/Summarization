christian benteke rescued aston villa from the drop zone with a brilliant late free-kick to seal his hat-trick and salvage a point against relegation rivals queens park rangers . tim sherwood’s team were set to drop into the bottom three when charlie austin scored his 17th premier league goal of the season 12 minutes from the end , before benteke’s intervention five minutes later to cap off a pulsating game . benteke was villa 's star man , twice pulling them level with three goals that earned a point at villa park . i can’t really understand why they scored 12 goals before i came in , incredible really for players with that kind of strike-rate ... we must keep our tempo up and shore it up at the back .
