despite being embroiled in the very public and traumatic feud where the vinceni girls were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother 's home in the middle of the night to go back to live with their father in 2012 , the girls have established healthy and happy lives in italy and speak to their mum every night . the four vincenti sisters , including the two older girls emil and claire , had a ' monster ' of a father who abused them and their mother , or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to italy . what had led up to the removal of the four sisters in australia and their return to italy was the fact that their mother had taken them from their home in italy on a ' vacation ' and never returned , claiming the girls ' father tomaso was an abuser .
