in more than 25 years as a scotland yard detective , i never met a raffles- or a thomas crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime . usually they will already be known directly to each other , perhaps because they worked on other jobs together . in the police 's criminal intelligence branch , the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear .
