you get the impression around english cricket at the moment that people have a bit of a downer on stuart broad . there should always be scrutiny on england players’ places , i have no problem with that , but we have to be careful we do not get confused between broad the bowler and broad the batsman . broad said in australia that he suffered nightmares after being struck in the face by india’s varun aaron last summer at old trafford , which is something i personally would never have done .
