the ' campaign ' continues against chelsea when it comes to penalties â€“ although in a first half with four penalty appeals it was clear that referee , michael oliver was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those . replays proved that to be incorrect as they showed slight contact on fabregas ' knee - perhaps not enough for a penalty but certainly enough contact to make the caution incorrect . arsenal had an appeal of their own when the ball span up and caught gary cahill on the arm but again i thought oliver was right as cahill was very close to the arsenal player and his arm was not in an unnatural position .
