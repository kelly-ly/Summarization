mr symonds decided to block a user called ' contribsx ' on tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by mr shapps or under his ' clear direction ' . mr shapps angrily denied the claims , insisting the story was ' untrue from start to finish ' . mr symonds ' decision was also criticised by other wikipedia activists , who warned that the site should not be used to ' play politics ' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee .
