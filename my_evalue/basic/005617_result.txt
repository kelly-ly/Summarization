visitors who venture onto or too close to north sentinel island risk being attacked by members of a mysterious tribe who have rejected modern civilisation and prefer to have zero contact with the outside world . when they do interact with outsiders , it usually involves violence â€“ the indigenous sentinelese tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in 2006 and have been known to fire arrows and fling rocks at low-flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions . following the 2004 tsunami this member of the sentinelese tribe was photographed firing an arrow at an indian coast guard helicopter .
