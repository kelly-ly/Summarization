tehsin nayani 's book , ' the glazer gatekeeper : six years speaking for manchester united 's silent owners ' , challenges popular perception about the us bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening £800m takeover in 2005 . sir bobby charlton talks with bryan glazer , joel glazer and avram glazer ( l-r ) at old trafford in 2005 . in 2010 , with anti-glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of cristiano ronaldo to real madrid for £80m , nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to joel glazer when he saw united legend david beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the stretford end following united 's champions league win over ac milan , for whom he was playing at the time .
