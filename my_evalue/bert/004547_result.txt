scientists may have captured the song of a new species of whale living in the antarctic . whale sounds are used by whales for different kinds of communication . while the complex sounds of the humpback whale and some blue whales are believed to be primarily used in sexual selection , all whales use simpler sounds all year round to communicate . it is very rare for strap-toothed wakes to be sighted as far south as the noises have been heard , while the noise is the wrong frequency for a grayâ€™s beaked whale , leaving the southern bottlenosed whale as the most likely match .
