a new video that shows homeless people reading out cruel tweets that have been written about them is guaranteed to form a lump in your throat . many of the people break down in tears as they read comments like , ' i hate the homeless , i donâ€™t feel sorry for you , ' and ' i saw a homeless girl across the street . i almost vomited . ' get back on your side of the bridge , no one likes you ' .
