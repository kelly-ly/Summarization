ed miliband will do ' more damage to the country than he did to his brother ' , boris johnson said this morning as the pair clashed on live tv . but mr miliband , who beat his elder brother david to the labour leadership in 2010 , ended up laughing off the attack , responding : ' come on boris , you 're better than that . ' mr johnson 's verbal mauling of the labour leader comes after the tories were accused of ' descending into the gutter ' for claiming that mr miliband may ' stab the country in the back ' by doing a deal with the snp to get into power .
