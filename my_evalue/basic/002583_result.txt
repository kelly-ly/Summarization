labour will warn that new official figures show 600 fewer gp surgeries across england are now open in the evening and weekends compared to the last election . shadow health secretary andy burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the ‘ nhs crisis’ as patients turn to stretched a & e departments as they struggle to get an appointment with their gp on the first working day after the easter break . health secretary jeremy hunt also said that the government had already begun tackling the issue by making extra funding available , which will mean the number of gp surgeries opening longer will have increased when the next set of figures are published .
