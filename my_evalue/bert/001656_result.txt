winning your flutter in this week 's grand national all depends on a string of superstitions and rituals , a survey has revealed . four out of ten britons betting on the grand national won last year by pineau de re , centre , make their choice purely down to the name of the horse while 70 per cent of women admit relying on pot luck . out of 2,000 britons who confirmed they would be having a bet , 40 per cent of them admitted their selection would be purely down to the name of the horse because it would have struck a chord . my own ritual is to always pick the well turned-out horse .
