you would be forgiven for thinking that the sun looked like a giant yolk after an amateur astronomer captured what looks like a chick sitting on its surface . the phenomenon is fairly common and the number of spots on the solar surface reflects with how active the sun is . but it all took a backseat when i went to university to study chemistry though . ' no , the picture on the left is not a sun spot ... : the photograph of the chick-like sunspot was taken using gordon ewen 's telescope that focuses on a specific wavelength of light .
