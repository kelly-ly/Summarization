the distinctive patterns on butterfly wings really do help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators . while scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been clearly tested . in some images they removed the owls eyes ( far left ) or removed the eye spots ( far right ) . last year scientists at oregon state university looked at the butterfly bycyclus anyana and showed that it varies the intensity of its eye spots depending on the season .
