ten years ago , i signed a letter backing labour in the 2005 election . these people are doing our economy and our society a service . he ignored them , the plan paid off , and now those same people are patting him on the back for his resolve . but that is what i fear would happen with a labour-snp government â€“ one that is anti-business , anti-aspiration and pro-spending money we have n't even earned yet .
