i encountered two such individuals on my mission to damascus -- jihad and mohammad -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from yarmouk in recent days , a place that was described last week by the u.n. like the wider syrian conflict , yarmouk has a human face ; the faces of young mohammad and young jihad . i will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside yarmouk , other civilians who need help where they are .
