debate : from left to right , scottish labour leader jim murphy , scottish conservative leader ruth davidson , first minister and snp leader nicola sturgeon and scottish liberal democrat leader willie rennie . and i’ll say to jim murphy this evening , that if there is an anti-tory majority in the house of commons after the election , even if the tories are the biggest party we will work with labour to keep david cameron out of downing street . ’ asked by mr murphy where she ‘wanted’ mr miliband to be prime minister , she said : ‘i’ don’t want david cameron to be prime minister ; i’m offering to help make ed miliband prime minister . ’ mr murphy replied : ‘ nicola , we don’t need your help . ‘ any seat that labour loses in scotland reduces the chances of ed miliband becoming prime minister . ’ scottish tory leader ruth davidson said the snp’s position – urging scots to vote against labour and also promising to prop up a labour government – was illogical .
