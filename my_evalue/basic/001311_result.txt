skipper john o'shea has challenged sunderland to keep their fate in their own hands by securing a fifth successive derby victory over newcastle . the wear-tyne rivals meet at the stadium of light on sunday with sunderland having won the last four meetings , but in grave need of three points to ease themselves away from the developing battle for barclays premier league survival . o'shea and his team-mates could find themselves inside the relegation zone by the time they run out if burnley get the better of tottenham in the day 's earlier kick-off , and that would make three points a necessity .
