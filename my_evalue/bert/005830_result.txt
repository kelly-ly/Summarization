in a bid to detract some of the attention away from apple 's official watch unveiling next week , motorola is launching a gold version of its own timepiece the day before . it will then go on general sale online and exclusively from o2 stores in the uk on 23 april . unlike motorola 's gold version , which is stainless steel coated in a gold colour , apple 's edition range ( pictured ) is made from 18 karat gold and has a price tag starting at $ 10,000 in the us and Â£8,000 in the uk .
