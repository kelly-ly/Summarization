after tony blairâ€™s speech in his former constituency of sedgefield last week , the former pm made an appearance at a low-key private fundraising dinner for 15 labour target seats . but despite the fact that blair has a record of three general election victories , only one shadow cabinet minister , chuka umunna , could be bothered to attend . during a dinner held in an indian banquet hall in morden , blair ( pictured last week in newton aycliffe , county durham ) name-checked ed miliband only once , devoting his speech instead to his own achievements .
