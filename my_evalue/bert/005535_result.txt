the girlfriend of a british student killed in the alps plane tragedy told last night how he switched flights ‘ at the last moment’ - and revealed she did not blame the co-pilot who crashed the jet . but girlfriend anneli tiirik , 23 , said she did not blame lubitz , 27 , who had hidden a sick note on the day of the crash and was found to have researched suicide methods in the days leading up to it . the music student - who began dating mr bramley four years ago - said she hoped airlines would bring in greater checks , such as brain scans , to prevent similar disasters in future . the mail on sunday reported last month how mr bramley’s father made an emotional appeal for the 150 dead not to be forgotten and demanded airlines be more ‘transparent’ .
