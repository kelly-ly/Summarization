the behaviour of some youngsters – who hurl chairs , bring fireworks to school and threaten to slit other pupils’ throats – is so horrendous that staff have refused to teach them . violent and disruptive pupils led the union to hold eight so-called refusal to teach ballots in schools last year . a year one boy ( age 6-7 ) was not excluded despite a history of physical assaults against staff and other pupils .
