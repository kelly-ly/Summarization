now , in honor of the lucky reunion with their ring , mr and mrs castillo have renewed their vows - and even asked mr roark , 22 , to serve as their ' padrino de anillo ' , or ' godfather of the ring ' for the ceremony , which took place in the same town as their original honeymoon . mr roark admitted when he first found the ring that he had no idea whether its owner would actually want it to be returned - or whether it had been cast into the water on purpose , in a willing attempt to ensure it remained lost . when he launched his initial campaign on facebook , mr roark posted a picture of the ring , before writing : ' ok , so while scuba diving around playa reef , playa del carmen last week , i happened to find this ring . ' helping hand : mr roark was scuba diving off the coast of playa del carmen in mexico when he found the wedding ring on the sea bed .
