nestled in eastern long island is a sleepy little town called yaphank where the streets have cozy names like oak and park , names that hide a dark past : they once bore signs like hitler and goebbels streets . where the children in the german american bund ( aka american nazis ) could fish , swim , hunt and learn about things like eugenics . the group set up pro-nazi camps where they could put on military demonstrations , teach their children about fascism and enjoy the outdoors . the fbi once noted that yaphank contained 150 to 300 children who ' used to wear a uniform like that of the hitler youth in germany .
