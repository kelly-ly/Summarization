this process will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable ' embryonic ' state , ' the firm says . ' once on orbit , these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to fabricate and integrate components such as antennas , shrouds , booms , concentrators , and optics . ' the ' trusselator ' device will enable construction of large support structures for systems such as multi-hundred-kilowat solar arrays , large solar sails , and football-field sized antennas . this ' trusselator ' device will enable construction of large support structures for systems such as multi-hundred-kilowat solar arrays , large solar sails , and football-field sized antennas .
