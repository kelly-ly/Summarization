there 's something about a city on a beach . just knowing that for half the year you can take a dip in the med after work , or sip ros√© on the terrace of a seafront restaurant as the sun sets must be like living in a perpetual mr benn adventure , where you enter the fancy dress shop , trade your suit for a sundress , and walk through the magic door to a beach party . no other city in the world has as many buildings on the unesco world heritage list as barcelona , from roman walls to the fantastical creations of gaudi . the food at the hotel arts is considered among the finest in barcelona .
