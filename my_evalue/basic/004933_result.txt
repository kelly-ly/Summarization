luo yi , general manager of china 's largest tibetan mastiff puppy farm , told people 's daily online : ' the anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift . ' it is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50kg in several chinese cities - including beijing , zhengzhou , shanghai and tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed 's popularity . tibetan mastiffs â€“ which were traditionally used in tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80kg .
