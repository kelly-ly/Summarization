chelsea do consider their sponsorship interests when the club buys a new player but the blues would never sign someone who is n't good enough , insists manager jose mourinho . the west london club , who agreed a Â£200million sponsorship deal with japanese tyre manufacturers yokohama rubber in february , are believed to have made an offer for fc tokyo forward yoshinori muto . the 22-year-old international would be the first japanese player to sign for chelsea if he completes a move to stamford bridge this summer , although mourinho is adamant that commercial deals would never fully dictate his transfer policy .
