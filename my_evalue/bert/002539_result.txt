some see the addition of jimmy graham to the seattle seahawks ' offense as one of the best moves of free agency , but michael bennett still thinks he 's overrated . i still feel the same way , ' bennett told 710 espn seattle . when he comes to our team , he 's a part of our team . i do n't feel as harsh as i did at the time because he 's my team-mate now , but at the time he was on the opposite team , a team that we played that was pretty good and we battled with them a couple times , and i did n't really like that team .
