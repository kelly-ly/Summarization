in a ' liquid armour ' this provides protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area . the liquid is called shear-thickening fluid ( stf ) , and does not conform to the model of newtonian liquids , such as water , in which the force required to move the fluid faster must increase exponentially , and its resistance to flow changes according to temperature . instead stf hardens upon impact at any temperature , providing protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area .
