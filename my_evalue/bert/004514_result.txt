peter scudamore rode an incredible 1,678 winners but has seen his achievements dwarfed by ap mccoy . not surprisingly , it is another mccoy record which still stands . 4 record 290 winners in a season ( 2001-02 ) the 300-winner season mccoy craved proved too much even for him but he got close with 289 in britain and one abroad . mccoy stands proud with his sport personality of the year award in birmingham in 2010 .
