the other day i was driving past the port at bristol and i saw all those thousands of cars lined up on the quayside – and whoa… i did a double take . you , too , may remember that mullet- haired decade . that is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the city , higher income tax , and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with – the result of labour’s failure to tackle the deficit . what makes this anti-capitalist agenda so dangerous is that the british motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms .
