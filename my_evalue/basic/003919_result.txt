when booking a holiday it is easy to be confused when it turns out your flight to vancouver in canada goes to airport code yvr , or why you will be landing in malaga , spain , at an airport with the code agp . while many main airports have codes which make sense , such as jfk for john f. kennedy international airport in new york , of lhr for london heathrow , others can leave passengers baffled - or in fits of laughter . sux - iowa 's sioux city airport ended up with the unfortunate three letter code sux and have tried to change it many times .
