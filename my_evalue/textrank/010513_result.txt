but this year 's cannes film festival has been declared a selfie-free zone after organisers asked celebrities to stop taking the ' ridiculous and grotesque ' images . while cannes director thierry fremaux admitted that he did not have the powers to ban the pictures altogether , he urged movie starts to resist the temptation . mr fremaux said that the ' ridiculous and grotesque ' pictures slowed the entire event down , causing problems for organisers ( pictured , jeremie renier takes a selfie at the photocall for saint laurent last year ) . cannes organizers have faced criticism for not selecting more films by female directors , but , or the first time in more than 25 years , this year 's festival will be opened by a film by a woman .
