tastes change , of course , but looking at some of the adverts that graced newspapers and magazines in the latter half of the 20th century , it 's hard to believe that the advertising brains behind them thought they might actually work . somebody call the fashion police ... although this man 's terrible jumper , seen in an advert for seagram 's extra dry gin does n't seem to have put off the lady holding said alcohol . like a time capsule from the era , the fashions are perfectly preserved ; the men generally seem to be sporting thick moustaches ( that many a modern-day hipster might covert ) and almost always on their arm is an attractive lady , usually not wearing a great deal .
