polls yesterday suggested the election will be too close to call – with the tories narrowly ahead in two , while another showed labour edging in front . the news came as an american pollster – who predicted the results of the 2008 us presidential election almost exactly – concluded that both main parties will struggle to cobble together any kind of workable majority . he would then have to try to gain support from smaller parties such as plaid cymru , the greens and northern ireland 's sdlp – but as they are projected to win only six seats between them , labour would still be one short of the necessary 323 .
