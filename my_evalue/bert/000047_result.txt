( cnn ) the powers of marvel 's all-star superheroes go a bit wobbly in `` avengers : age of ultron . '' picking up where last year 's `` captain america : winter soldier '' left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty hydra organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves clint barton/hawkeye ( jeremy renner ) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins pietro and wanda ( aaron-taylor johnson and elizabeth olsen ) . galaxy quest ' tv series in the works . `` avengers : age of ultron '' succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do , but this time the action scenes do n't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no-man's-land .
