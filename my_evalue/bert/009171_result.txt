a waterfall gushing over the harbour bridge , a man surfing waves in front of the opera house and a crocodile stalking flood water inside a train station are just a few of the fake photos to emerge from the sydney storm . in lewisham , a suburb in the inner west of sydney , an unlikely visitor was spotted in the flood water at the train station . and the video of a wave rider surfing in front of sydney’s opera house was nothing but a hoax – even when it started trending for a second time . and in a nod to the # umbrellageddon hashtag that emerged on social media as sydneysiders posted photos of their umbrellas destroyed and abandoned in the gutters , one reddit user shared a picture of soldiers in the marine corps war memorial in arlington , virginia , holding up an umbrella instead of the american flag .
