a celtic treble is gone , but the recriminations , anger and sense of injustice will linger and fester for some time to come . and the turning point for this latest triumph came in 53 minutes . for lukasz zaluska , craig gordon 's deputy , the task of keeping greg tansey 's penalty out with his first touch was a tall order . whatever the celtic injustices , they can hardly deny their opponents played to devastating effect on the break .
