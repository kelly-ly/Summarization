a couple take on the part of st george and the dragon to enjoy the festivities in leadenhall market , watching the morris men perform . the parade in nottingham was organised by the royal society of st george , a 200-year-old organisation with branches all over the world . ' because today is a day to celebrate all that makes england great , a day to feel pride for all that our country has given the world - from magna carta to the language of shakespeare , from the industrial revolution to the world wide web .

' whenever the issue of st george 's day comes up - and i can predict this on twitter today - there will be many left-centre people who will tweet the fact that st george was from what 's today known as turkey as if that is the start , finish of conversation and that makes st george 's day irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous .
