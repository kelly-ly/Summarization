jonas gutierrez was dropped after a fallout with newcastle head coach john carver – and is now set to be released at the end of the season . however , sportsmail also understands that gutierrez trained with the first-team on monday and will be in the squad for saturday’s visit of swansea with both carver and the player keen to move on from their dispute . the cancer , however , returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in argentina . it is clear that they look after the club 's interests , but i think in a situation like that , you need to consider other things , even more as i had been playing for five years before having this problem .
