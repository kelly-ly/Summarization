scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old . the fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time , like the one labelled a , but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed , labelled b , allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted ( c ) . he said : ' original coloration patterns — if not the actual colors themselves —sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light , which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce .
