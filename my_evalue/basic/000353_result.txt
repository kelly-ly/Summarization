on thursday , apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it . rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity , sexual orientation , race or even hair color is part of mainstream america -- despite what others might say . in fact , thanks to apple , we may even see brown santa emojis this december .
