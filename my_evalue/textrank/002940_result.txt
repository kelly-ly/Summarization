there are numerous mentions of blood moons in the bible , such as in the book of joel , chapter two , which says the ' day of the lord will be as when the sun refuses to shine ' and in luke , which hints that signs in the sun , moon and stars will tell of the second coming . while the bible prophesises blood moons , it does not give a timeline of when the significant event will happen . blood moons - an image from the last event is shown- are predicted in the bible .
