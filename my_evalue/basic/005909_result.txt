there is a rich and mildly amusing irony about arsenal fans calling chelsea boring for defending well , when these gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003-04 . mesut ozil has been sublime in recent weeks but he did n't do enough against chelsea on sunday . and so as i sat down to watch arsenal face chelsea , i felt confident that ozil could be the difference between the two teams .
