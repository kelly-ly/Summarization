a holocaust survivor who last week forgave a 93-year-old former ss officer - known as the ' bookkeeper of death ' - has angered her fellow plaintiffs by saying he should not be prosecuted . she argued that any nazis still alive should instead come forward to speak publicly about what they did to help counter the threat of neo-nazi holocaust deniers in germany . she told the hearing how they evaded being gassed on arrival at the death camp thanks to mengele 's twisted obsession with twins . in 1984 she founded the organization candles ( an acronym for ' children of auschwitz nazi deadly lab experiments survivors ' ) , through which she located 122 other living mengele twins , as the experiment survivors came to be known .
