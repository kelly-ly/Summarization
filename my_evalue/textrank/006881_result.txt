wasps are set to appeal the three-match ban handed to no 8 nathan hughes for knocking out george north . north was out cold on the pitch at franklin 's gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . hughes was given the suspension - to include three meaningful fixtures - after being found guilty of striking north in the 52-30 aviva premiership defeat at franklin 's gardens on march 27 . commenting on the judgement made on tuesday night , disciplinary officer sir james dingemans said : ' this was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found . ' however , there was recklessness meaning that , notwithstanding the harm , it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record . ' wales winger north suffered a third confirmed concussion in just four months against wasps last friday .
