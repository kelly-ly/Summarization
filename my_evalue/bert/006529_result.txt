angela merkel threw down the gauntlet to david cameron last night and said large countries should be prepared to accept more asylum seekers . david cameron insisted at an emergency eu summit on thursday that the uk would not take any of the refugees â€“ because it was already doing its part by virtue of having the continent 's largest aid and defence budgets . but germany has long accused southern eu countries of ignoring the rules and encouraging asylum-seekers to move on . the german government is believed to be particularly concerned that the italian authorities are not doing enough to register asylum-seekers who arrive there .
