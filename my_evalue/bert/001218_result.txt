if selected on sunday , david templeton will form part of a rangers guard of honour to recognise the outstanding championship success of his former club . i know that i 'm good enough to get back to that and hopefully the manager sees that in me . ' every one of their players will have that . it is a test for us but every game between now and the end of the season will bring a test .
