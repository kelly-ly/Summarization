indeed , church doctrine states that anybody who takes their transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery can not be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion . according to the tribune , around 30 transgender mormons meet every week in a support group , and have started to get the attention of senior church members . he told the tribune that after being told about gender identity disorder by his mother , he prayed to god asking ' am i your son ? ' and felt the answer was ' yes ' .
