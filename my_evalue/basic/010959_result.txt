those lucky enough to snag a ticket to the star-studded – on and off the stage - coachella valley music and arts festival at the empire polo club in indio , california , which runs for its second weekend from april 17-19 , are spending more than any other major festival goers . while checking out headliners such as ac/dc , jack white , florence and the machine and madonna , who bizarrely made out with rapper drake on sunday , coachella visitors pay an average of £187 per day according to travel money specialist no.1 currency . england’s glastonbury , running june 24 to 28 and featuring foo fighters in 2015 , is the third most expensive with a £113 per day cost calculated from the five-day £565 ticket and an estimated average of £68 per day for meals and drinks .
