professor argye hillis , a neurologist at john hopkins medical school who oversaw the study , said : ' failure to recognize sarcasm can lead to important miscommunications . ' few previous studies have identified brain lesions associated with impaired recognition of sarcasm . ' percent damage to the sagittal stratum had the greatest weight and was the only independent predictor of sarcasm recognition . ' even for healthy people sarcasm can be hard to detect and some cultures use it far more than others . according to livescience , professor hillis said that in the general population , most people should be able to identify 90 per cent of sarcastic comments . she said the findings could be used to help patients who have suffered brain damage regain the ability to recognise sarcastic cues and help families communicate to their loved ones more effectively .
