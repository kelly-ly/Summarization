why would you spend your holiday at another nondescript hotel , when you could have your own island , and stay in a 19th century lighthouse , all for the same price as a b & b . the quaint cottage is a comfortable stay and can be hired for the small sum of €200 ( £145 ) for two nights . suitable for adventurers only , guests will lodge in the cottage once used by the lighthouse keepers , who had to manually guide boats through the waters on the carantec coast . despite lacking a high-tech interior , the lighthouse cottage offers spectacular views over the bay and guests can enjoy sunsets whilst having a bbq on the cottage patio while listening the waves crash against the rocks .
