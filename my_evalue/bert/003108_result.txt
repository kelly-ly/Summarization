a traumatised mother has been left with a phobia of all things yellow after she was hit by a canary-coloured taxi . the 51-year-old had to leave her job as a barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered when the yellow taxi struck her in may last year . i 'm terrified of them , and if i saw a yellow taxi on the street i would feel this urge just to drive into it . ' more severe cases of this phobia can hinder daily activities for some people .
