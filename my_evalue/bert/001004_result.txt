lausanne , switzerland ( cnn ) a roller-coaster series of talks wrapped up thursday in lausanne as a group of world powers known as the p5+1 reached a framework agreement with iran over the country 's nuclear program . the success of that agreement remains to be seen . and zarif took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel , perhaps just hoping to take in the view , but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock . while these journalists had a bit more access to officials , they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building , including the hotel 's reception desk , the first-floor restrooms and the two-michelin-star restaurant 's entrees , costing 200 francs or more .
