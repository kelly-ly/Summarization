the number plate that got jeremy clarkson and his former top gear colleagues harangued out of argentina was a direct reference to the falklands war , a judge has ruled . clarkson and his colleagues fled the south american country last year when their convoy - which was led by a porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack . afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another . a local councillor in ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the ford mustang richard hammond had driven were close to the 255 britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on james mayâ€™s lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 argentinian casualties .
