tom lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as hull fc beat widnes 22-8 to make it back-to-back wins for the first time since last june . the vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second hull try when stefan marsh and chris dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads . lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former black and whites hooker aaron heremaia . what might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as lineham intercepted brown 's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with castleford 's justin carney on nine for the season .
