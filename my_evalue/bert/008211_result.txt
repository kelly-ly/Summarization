a bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in sydney 's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when belinda bartholomew , the girlfriend of roosters star aidan guerra , tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a game of thrones-inspired feast . the war of words started , ms bartholomew claims , when the man working at sam the butcher in bondi called her a 'f***ing c*** ' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up . ms bartholomew claims the man working at sam the butcher in bondi swore at her and told her to leave , but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . i 'm going to assume it was n't me who he was really angry at , however i just happened to be in there at the time .
