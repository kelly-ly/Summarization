the andaz liverpool street hotel in london used to be bedlam , but not through cavalier management , rebellious staff or disruptive guests . but weâ€™ve chosen it for a certain bespoke flourish , for this is one of four rooms in the andaz which has been decorated by trendy artists . delightful design : the andaz liverpool street features a knowing nod to new york 's guggenheim museum . dinner at the andaz , in its 1901 restaurant , is truly an experience to savour .
