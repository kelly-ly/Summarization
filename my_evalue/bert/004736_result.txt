the first farmers came to europe 8,000 years ago and spread early agricultural practices , starting in greece . experts from centre for international research in the humanities and social sciences ( cirhus ) in new york city studied neolithic ornaments ( pictured ) to understand how farming spread . based on discoveries of different types of neolithic ornaments in different parts of europe , they concluded that northern europeans in the neolithic period initially rejected the practice of farming , which was otherwise spreading throughout the continent . their findings show a bump in the road of the adoption of farming , which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘ major economic revolution’ .
