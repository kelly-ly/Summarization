a pair of turkey-sized ‘ egg thief lizards’ dubbed romeo and juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock ( pictured ) in the mid-90s . palaeontologists led by scott persons ( pictured ) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones . ‘ my analysis of the tail skeletons supported this theory , because the skeletons showed adaptations for both high tail flexibility and enlarged tail musculature - both traits that would have helped an oviraptor to flaunt its tail fan in a mating dance , ’ mr persons said . ‘ we discovered that , although both oviraptors were roughly the same size , the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards , “romeo” had larger and specially shaped tail bones , ’ mr persons said .
