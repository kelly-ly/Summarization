sunday night 's towie saw dan edgar agree to give his relationship with jessica wright a second chance - and on the evidence of her latest photoshoot it is n't surprising . the towie star is the first ever celebrity to front an ann summers campaign and has been selected for not only her stunning figure but her ' fun , fearless attitude and fashion business credentials ' . i 'm really looking forward to seeing the response to the campaign . ' jess has a great following from towie , a demographic that we know to be switched on to our brand . '
