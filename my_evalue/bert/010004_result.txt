the podium girl is the centre of a ' sexism storm ' after lewis hamilton sprayed champagne in her face said she was n't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job . others have called the driving ace an ' embarrassment to the uk ' , while another said his actions showed that he was an ' ignorant clown ' . it is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it . then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer , so i 'm unhappy about that .
