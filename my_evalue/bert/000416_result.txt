( cnn ) china 's cybercensors have long used a `` great firewall '' to block its citizens from reading critical articles from western news websites or consuming other content it disapproves of . one of the great cannon 's targets that the researchers studied was an obvious one -- greatfire.org , run by chinese expats bent on fighting beijing 's censorship . they are confident it is also in china and say it is technically similar to the great firewall . if it sees requests going out into the world for content it does n't want citizens to see , the researchers say , it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the chinese user 's computer to make them stop communicating .
