the widespread australian perception is that the president owed his power to pdi-p chairperson and former president megawati sukarnoputri . believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country , some suggest that megawati insisted widodo stand by his hard-line anti-drugs policy and stare down australian pressure -- or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process . as the duo attracted greater public sympathy -- including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging jakarta to reconsider -- the good , great and popular in australian society also united behind the plea for mercy . credible accusations by the defense attorney for the two australians that a lighter sentence was denied to them because of their incapacity to pay the bribe demanded of them from the sentencing judges affirmed perceptions of indonesia 's judicial system as corrupt if not incompetent . particularly galling for the abbott government and australians was widodo 's refusal to even accept a phone call from abbott to discuss the issue , and the wall of silence and non-engagement that confronted australian ministers attempting to plead the case with indonesian counterparts .
