just last month the family-owned creamery issued its first recall in its 108-year history after the us centers for disease control and prevention linked ice cream contaminated with listeriosis to three deaths at a kansas hospital . the recalls are uncommon : listeria is n't usually found in ice cream , since the bacteria ca n't grow at freezing temperatures . a spokesman for the food and drug administration said the agency has no evidence , for now , that the listeria found in jeni 's ice cream and the listeria found in blue bell ice cream are connected . ' at this time , the fda does not believe that the finding of listeria in one sample of jeni 's splendid ice creams is related to the outbreak and recall associated with blue bell ice cream , ' said spokesman jeff ventura .
