cleanse , tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women , sold by the beauty industry as a sure-fire way to fresh , glowing skin . toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime , leaving skin dewy and pores closed . geoff genesky , kiehl’s head of laboratory , emphasises that consumers should also be careful to follow product instructions very carefully , especially when using products that have anti-ageing benefits but that can be a bit harsh to the skin 's outermost layers . ' making sure to wear sunscreens when using retinol or alpha hydroxy acid products comes to mind , ' he said . ' as does limiting application to once or twice a week in the case of products with high concentrations of acid exfoliating ingredients or cleansers with particularly rough scrub particles . ' do n't use too much product - and do n't be lured by expensive creams . ' do n't be swayed by marketing hype - using the right product for your skin type is key , ' advises emma leslie , editor at escentual.com . ' buying a cult £120 moisturiser that 's optimised for dry skin when your skin is oily means that you wo n't reap its full benefits , and your skin will start to misbehave .
