i love the buzz when i launch a piece on the internet and on google analytics , you suddenly see society engaging ... millions and millions of people engaging . '' with comments and blogs and people saying ' it 's not art ' and people working out the science behind it and people complaining ... `` in a way , it challenges the whole idea of contemporary art , by asking : ' hang on , a piece of art you ca n't really see , is it really a piece of art ? ' ''
