now engineers claim to have designed a range of synthetic eyes that may one day let us replace and even enhance our own sense of vision . this project is based on the idea of augmenting the sight sense , increasing the functionalities of the eye with ones currently handled by other body segments or external devices . ' under mhox designs , patients with eye disease will inthe future be able to replace their eye with a synthetic one printed in a laboratory . they say a socket that connects the eye to the brain - which would require a surgical operation - would allow eyes to be interchangable .
