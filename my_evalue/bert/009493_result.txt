ronald koeman has promised not leave southampton this summer , even if barcelona were to come calling . only a point is needed to break the record premier league points tally set last season under mauricio pochettino , who returns to st mary 's for the first time since leaving last summer when tottenham arrive on saturday . no , i stay . it is a very nice experience to be part of the premier league .
