the scene in the old government house hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war . fiercely individual , the islands have never before combined to stage a big event . the jersey museum and art gallery has a catalogue of copies of the jersey evening post dating back 125 years , its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail ( albeit through a fog of strict german control ) . the nearby maritime museum proffers the occupation tapestry gallery – a montage of bright images , stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995 , which depict jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets , the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire .
