wine experts have created a guide to matching wine with snacks that recommends pairing pinot grigio with nachos and shiraz rose with salt and vinegar crisps . they even found that different wines match different pizza toppings - with shiraz best for a margherita but a meaty cabernet sauvignon with a pepperoni . chardonnay works with wasabi peas due to the ' creaminess of the wine taking the heat out of the horseradish ' with toasted pittas and hummus going nicely with the same wine because of the ' peach and melon notes complimenting the nutty flavours of the chickpeas ' .
