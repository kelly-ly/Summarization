standing isolated surrounded by the vast , golden north saudi arabian desert is a bizarre single rock castle , which has been lying undisturbed for centuries . the tomb is the largest of 131 monumental tombs , which were carved straight into rock in the city of mada'in saleh during the pinnacle of nabatean era . it is remarkable how the lonely castle has remained so preserved against the elements for over 1,900 years and this can be attributed to the dry climate . impressive collection !
