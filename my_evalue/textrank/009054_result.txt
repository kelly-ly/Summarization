in july this year new horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit pluto . after passing pluto , new horizons will flyby one or several kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , other bodies beyond the orbit of pluto . our best images of pluto so far come from the hubble space telescope ( shown is one of the images ) , so the arrival of new horizons is hugely exciting for scientists , who have waited many years to catch a glimpse of this distant world and unravel some of its secrets .
