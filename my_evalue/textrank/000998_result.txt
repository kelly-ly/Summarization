washington ( cnn ) supreme court justices appeared divided tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage , with justice anthony kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court 's pivotal vote . many questions on tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system . `` if you support gay marriage you will burn in hell , '' the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream .
