it has long been thought that stone age man abandoned their dead with little thought or respect . the discovery of cremated bone ( pictured ) , thought to be the earliest ever identified in britain , could re-write the history of mesolithic , or middle stone age burial practices . it hints that people respected the dead enough to cremate them and not simply abandon them , as has been previously believed . more flints were found nearby , as well as a bronze age barrow , early roman site , saxon settlement and a medieval building all where the essex and suffolk water pipeline is planned .
