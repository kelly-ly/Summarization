over the years iâ€™ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in lorena ochoa and laura davies . but none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with charley hull , the best teenage golfer in britain . hull hit drives that pitched past mine .
