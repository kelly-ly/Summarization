lewis hamilton is creating a bit of a track record for himself - and this one is n't on the starting grid . celebrating his win at the chinese grand prix on sunday , he sprayed champagne straight into the face of one of the hostesses . if this if the case we think lewis hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future . it was unnecessarily close with sebastian as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time because i had to cover him .
