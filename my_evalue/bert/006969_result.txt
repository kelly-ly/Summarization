a south american president appears to have fallen for the oldest trick in the book after unwittingly posing for a photo next to a child wearing an ' i 'm with stupid ' t-shirt . it also prompted thousands of comments including the suggestion that the child was a cia agent brought in to damage the president 's reputation . according to the bbc , the boy 's mother said that her son had not known the meaning of the t-shirt himself and she is quoted as saying : ' we do n't want to shame the president ' . correa , who was first elected in 2006 , is popular among ecuadorians for his government 's social spending but has also faced criticism for intolerance of dissent .
