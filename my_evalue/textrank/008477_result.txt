an australian businesswoman has come out on top against the world 's 13th richest billionaire after stopping benefit cosmetics from using the term ' brow bar ' exclusively . she said customers would confuse her business , the brow bar , with benefit brow bar at myer stores in western australia , new south wales , australian capital territory , queensland , south australia and victoria . she added the addition of the word ' benefit ' to ' brow bar ' also did not help differentiate the cosmetic giant 's services from ms noonan 's business .
