a church will hold its maundy thursday service today instead of tomorrow to allow a weekly drop-in session for prostitutes to go ahead . we want to be a reliable , safe and loving place for women , it is important to honour our promise and it has had a real impact on the whole church here . ' one of the stories we tell on maundy thursday is about jesus being anointed by a woman of low status and it felt wrong to cancel it . ' maundy thursday , also known as easter thursday , is the beginning of the three-day celebration of easter .
