but perhaps most bizarrely , or interestingly from the perspective of chelsea supporters , the alleged new kit can be bought with ' bale 9 ' on the back . a brazilian website is claiming to have the new chelsea kit for sale , with gareth bale 's name on the back . bale ( centre ) has struggled at real madrid this season and reports have linked him with a return to england . skeptical chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without bale 's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of didier drogba .
