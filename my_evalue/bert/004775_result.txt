baseball has long been considered america 's favorite pastime , so it should come as no surprise that most people feel very strongly when it comes to their favorite professional team . the new york yankees ( left ) and boston red sox ( right ) come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite . the graph , created by facebook , uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner . and with the exception of those aforementioned yankees , red sox and recent world series champs san francisco giants , who get some love in hawaii , most teams only really get support near their home field .
