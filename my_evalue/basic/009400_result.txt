hector bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans , and possibly even by his manager , as arsenal 's premier right back , after impressing in the absence of mathieu debuchy . the young spaniard scored his second premier league goal , cutting inside and curling left-footed past simon mignolet , in the 4-1 win over liverpool last weekend , and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back . but , it seems , in the dressing room , it is his status as the club 's premier sprinter , rather than as a defender , that is most in question , after he beat theo walcott 's 40 metre club sprint record last summer .
