when jade and ross morley were told that their first baby , floyd-henry , had a rare form of dwarfism called achondroplasia , they made the decision that their son would be celebrated instead of pitied . he is so funny and loves a bit of attention . in two weeks he 's having an operation to put in his gromits [ hearing aids ] which we 're looking forward to because at the moment it would just sound to him like he 's underwater . ' then i can tell them that floyd is just like you or me but small . '
