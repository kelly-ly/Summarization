i was 27 at the time , and , like most young people i had stopped going to church . but , on that day -- that terrible day -- i desperately needed to understand why god took my brother . i do n't know if all catholic churches would have shut me out , but i figured , at the time , it was part of the long list of rules the vatican required catholic leaders to follow .
