a dilapidated country mansion in the scottish highlands that was once the secret love nest of coco chanel and the earl of grosvenor has gone on the market for Â£3million . she redesigned the whole of the building 's interior , making the property unique in the uk and despite leaving the home 85 years ago , a number of the rooms still bear her work . as well as the main house on the 700 acre estate , it also comes with five outbuildings including a cottage set near to a wooded area . bennie is very well and , i think , extremely happy to be mated with an equal - her ability balancing his power .
