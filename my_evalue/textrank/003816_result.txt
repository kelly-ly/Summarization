preconceptions , i find , can be really unhelpful , so before travelling to the datai , a luxury hotel in malaysia , i decided not to find out anything about it . designed by australian architect kerry hill around datai bay - a white sandy crescent beach voted one of the ten most beautiful in the world , with its magnificent backdrop of jungle and mountains - the resort took three years to complete . he sourced wood , marble and stone from across the island and mainland malaysia to create mayan walls , malay roofs and japanese screens .
