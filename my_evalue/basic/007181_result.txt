taken at the dawn of photography , these unique pictures are some of the first ever taken of the city of bristol , nearly 100 years before much of its historic centre was destroyed by nazi bombing . everything from the waterfront , city centre and st mary redcliffe church can be seen in the shots , as well as the fourteen stars tavern building which was pulled down in 1857 . other shots are almost identical , including the one of st john 's gate at the church of st john the baptist , which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the second world war .
