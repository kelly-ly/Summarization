despite the fact that iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920 , well-known fantasy , sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late , prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide . although the country 's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen , there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as game of thrones , interstellar or prometheus . scenes from christopher nolan’s epic interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier svinafellsjokull in the skaftafell national park , which is also located near another favoured filming location : iceland’s largest glacier , vatnajokull .
