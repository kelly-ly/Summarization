henry louis gates stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his pbs documentary series `` finding your roots '' because the actor ben affleck put pressure on him . affleck 's concern was that the segment would have aired his family 's dirty laundry , which includes a slaveholding ancestor , benjamin cole . if gates thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it did n't make for good television , there would have been no need to consult with lynton ; gates could have given affleck what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong affleck 's story was .
