leeds striker steve morison admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the skybet championship side . i 've never known anything like it in football and i 've played for teams scrapping for their lives - millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted . according to the manager , silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover , while antenucci and cani declared themselves unfit after training on thursday with the rest pulling out following a ' light ' session on friday . the withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued leeds .
