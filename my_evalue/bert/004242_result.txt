why would you spend your holiday at another nondescript hotel , when you could have your own island , and stay in a 19th century lighthouse , all for the same price as a b & b . ile louët is set 1148 ft from the shore in brittany and is the perfect retreat for up to 10 guests costing just £145 . bit chilly ! an old pigsty was converted to be a new bathroom , which is separate from the house .
