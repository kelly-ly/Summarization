the u.s. supreme court 's arguments on tuesday over same-sex marriage will cap more than two decades of litigation and a transformation in public attitudes . in his most recent gay rights decision for the court in 2013 , rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man and woman for purposes of federal benefits , kennedy deplored that u.s. law for making gay marriages ' unequal . ' that 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right to same-sex marriage , but lower court judges interpreted the ruling as an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans .
