graeme mcdowell tees off on the third hole during the third round at augusta on saturday . you have to be a 'front-edge ' putter like bubba ( watson ) , i 've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than bubba . mcdowell 's score could have been even worse after he was initially given a one-shot penalty for moving his marker as he attempted to swat a bee away from his ball on the third green .
