that honour falls to mohammad shatnawi of jordanian club al faisaly , whose effort will be considered as one of the strangest own goals ever . mohammed shatnawi bizarrely scored an own goal by kicking the ball over his head at the weekend . shatnawi kept his eyes on the ball , leaned back , raised his right leg and kicked it over his head , one would imagine in an unorthodox attempt to send the ball over his goal and out for a corner .
