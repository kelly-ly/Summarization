it can also reportedly be used to increase fuel efficiency and even reduce noise on take-off and landing . the project is a collaboration between nasa , the air force research laboratory ( afrl ) and flexsys from ann arbor michigan . figures suggest the breakthrough could increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent , and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent , compared to traditional wing flaps ( one shown on a boeing 737 ) .
