ben affleck today finally admitted the name of the slave ancestor he had censored from his past . the oscar-winning actor posted on social media that a ' benjamin cole ' of georgia , an ancestor on his mother 's side , was the relative dropped from the pbs show about his family history . it is an examination well worth continuing . while i do n't like that the guy is an ancestor , i am happy that aspect of our country 's history is being talked about .
