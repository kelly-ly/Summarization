following heavy defeats at tikrit in iraq and the appalling costly siege of kobane , islamic state have launched their own social media rules to censor coverage on its recent defeats . perhaps the strangest and most unclear rule reads : ' the stupendous spread of mujahideen along a specific locations ' it appears unknown what the extremist group meant by ' the stupendous spread of mujahideen .
