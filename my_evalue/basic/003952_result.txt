le manoir aux quat'saisons had been on my wish list for a while - and mum is such a huge fan of raymond blanc she once confessed he could be her mastermind subjectâ€¦ . nestled in the green rolling hills of the chilterns , le manoir is a striking building ; a 15th century manor house built with golden bricks and burgundy roof tiles , and boasting tall chimney stacks and climbing wisteria . lucy verasamy proudly shows one of the healthy and tasty dishes created at le manoir aux quat'saisons .
