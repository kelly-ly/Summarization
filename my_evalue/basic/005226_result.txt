an afghan interpreter who risked his life on the front line with british troops was shot with his two-year-old son by taliban hitmen after he says he was ‘abandoned’ by the uk government . the 26-year-old , who was known as ‘chris’ by uk soldiers , was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in khost , eastern afghanistan . his son muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack , which chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him because of his time spent helping the british government – which now won’t let him come to the uk .
