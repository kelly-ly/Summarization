the french rugby federation is looking for candidates to replace france coach philippe saint-andre following the world cup . since taking over from marc lievremont , who led france to the world cup final in 2011 , saint-andre has failed to impose himself , winning only 15 of his 37 games in charge . he has overseen poor results in the six nations , finishing no higher than fourth and even last in 2013 . the ffr launched the application process to find his replacement on friday , with candidates having until april 25 to declare their bid .
