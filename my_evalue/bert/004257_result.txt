a taxi driver channelled his inner pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers . at first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the pavarotti song in perfect tune . he then begins singing along himself – loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road . thank you very much . ’
