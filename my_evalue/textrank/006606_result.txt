both clubs have a history of fan trouble but leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club , council or police , when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans . our preference was for cardiff city fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season , and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted , ' cardiff ceo ken choo said in a statement . ' with the intelligence and information available however , we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk . ' as stated by our supporter groups , we also believe that west yorkshire police could manage the event without issue or restrictions , if they chose to do so . cardiff city supporters club chairman clive francis said , ' cardiff city supporters club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the football club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups .
