rangers ' teenage striker ryan hardie marked his first ever light blues start with a brace as stuart mccall 's side clinched a 3-1 win over dumbarton . hardie 's brace comes as rangers boss stuart mccall fulfills his promise of fielding more academy players . and he stayed good to his word as hardie - who has notched more than 30 times for the club 's under-20s side - and winger tom walsh came in to replace kenny miller and dean shiels following wednesday 's 1-1 slip-up at livingston . but , with his back to goal , he sent the ball over his own shoulder with a flick of his toe and watched it bounce past rogers ' dive into the bottom corner .
