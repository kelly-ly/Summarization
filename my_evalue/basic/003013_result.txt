as so-called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long , more powerful waves dragging across the ocean 's floor to create the constant hum . as short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long waves on the ocean 's floor to create a constant hum . using data from 2008 , a french team found that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation .
