( cnn ) robert bates , 73 , shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police . on april 2 , bates thought he was going to use a taser on eric harris , who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a lugar pistol and then took off running . auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police . that would be a mistake .
