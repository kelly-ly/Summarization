an offensive attempt by a men 's magazine to commemorate fallen anzac soldiers has backfired as social media users and the department of veteran affairs condemn the crude ' commemorative issue ' . the department of veteran affairs ( dva ) said the word ' anzac ' is protected by federal legislation since 1920 and is not authorised to be used for commercial purposes- like zoo weekly 's ' special anzac centenary issue'- without express permission from the minister for veterans ' affairs . zoo weekly removed images of a bikini clad woman holding a red poppy after being criticised by the department of veteran affairs for using the word ' anzac ' without permission .
