now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane – a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide . scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane – a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide . bünz says that there are many places in the arctic ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the knipovich ridge . rather than causing a concern , the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments .
