so what 's changed between the shooting death of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , in august , and that of walter scott in north charleston , south carolina , last weekend ? north charleston : though it 's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it 's 100 % clear from the video that scott was not posing a threat to officer michael slager when the policeman opened fire on scott as he ran away . it would be tough to extrapolate for certain , but it 's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer , and that quick reaction by authorities in south carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in ferguson as the process of determining wilson 's fate dragged on for months .
