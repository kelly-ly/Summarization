in a hurry : katrina maddox , 23 , with baby edward , who was born in the back of an ambulance . in an unusual twist of fate , described as a ' million to one shot ' , a young mother has given birth in the back of an ambulance for the second time in as many years after her baby boy was born on the same stretch of busy main road as his brother . her second little boy came along on the a47 in norfolk two years after mrs maddox , of north pickenham , near swaffham , had her first child reuben in exactly the same way . at least this time peter was able to be by my side rather than delivering his son himself .
