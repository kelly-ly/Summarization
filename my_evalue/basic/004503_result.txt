british company swan , which sold its first iron in 1933 , has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron , for £279.99 . the steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron , shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons ( think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe ) — cutting through creases quicker . this does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control , which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam .
