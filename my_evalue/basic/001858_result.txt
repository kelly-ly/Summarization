this season , for the second time in three years , there were no english clubs in the quarter-finals of the champions league , while none of our clubs have reached the last eight in the europa league either . even if italian clubs fail to reach finals , a repeat of this season would see them overtake england in third place next season . germany is guaranteed to move ahead of england at the end of this season , while if italian clubs continue to perform well this season and english clubs fail to reverse their slump , the premier league could end next season out of europe 's elite .
