luke shaw thought he had done ok as he walked off the old trafford pitch at half-time during manchester united’s fa cup tie against arsenal last month . the score was 1-1 and shaw , returning to the team for the first time since united’s defeat at swansea city in february , had kept arsenal flyer alex oxlade-chamberlain reasonably quiet . louis van gaal substituted the £28million defender , telling shaw that he was not fit enough to play for united , and replaced him with phil jones for the second half .
