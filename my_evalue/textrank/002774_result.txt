research on infants’ brains by doctors from oxford university has found that young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults . up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving , but otherwise were given no pain medication . but injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief , and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child’s pain .
