buildings draped in vibrant flowers , jagged shapes of light origami designed to trick the mind , and forests of floating white dresses are just some of the magical installations coming to this year 's vivid sydney festival . each winter since 2009 the city has come alight with mind-bending light shows projected onto iconic buildings such as the sydney harbour bridge , opera house , customs house and the museum of contemporary art . spectators can look forward to customs house coated in jacarandas , a translucent pop up bar in martin place , a light origami maze , glowing swings with the sydney harbour bridge as the backdrop and the sails of the opera house lit up again .
