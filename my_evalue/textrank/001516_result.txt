uefa 's increase in champions league money gives celtic manager ronny deila extra reasons to qualify . ‘ our prime target is the champions league and we have to do what is best for the club . ’ towards that end , deila - now a more confident and assured figure than the man who took the parkhead job last summer - will assume personal control of the pre-season programme and argue for the retention of key players . by this time last year , celtic had won the scottish title at a canter - allowing former manager neil lennon to grant key players early rest prior to the euro challenge ahead .
