a search for a sewage pipe beneath an italian restaurant yielded two centuries worth of history . eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant , the building has been turned into museum faggiano ( pictured ) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to allied fighters fighting the nazis in the second world war . but when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone , beneath which was a messapian tomb , built by people who lived in the area before the birth of jesus .
