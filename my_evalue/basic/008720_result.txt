the cyg-11 seaplane ( above ) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing-in-ground effect to glide . the vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing-in-ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft 's wings are close to the ground . the cyg-11 aircraft , which have been developed by the hainan yingge wing in ground effect craft manufacturing company with russian engineers , can carry 10 passengers plus two flight crew .
