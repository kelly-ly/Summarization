stuart mccall admits he will become a livingston fan for the day on wednesday as he prays the scottish championship strugglers can do his side 's play-off bid a favour . the easter road outfit slipped four points behind mccall 's side on saturday while they were busy getting knocked out of the william hill scottish cup by falkirk as rangers were winning 3-1 at dumbarton in league action . former celtic striker mark wilson put the sons ahead after just two minutes with his first goal since netting an old firm winner against gers back in march 2011 , but hardie saved the day with his brace before haris vuckic swept home a 25-yeard beauty to put the seal on the glasgow side 's victory .
