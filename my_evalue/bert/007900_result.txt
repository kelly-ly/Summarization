if manuel pellegrini leaves the barclays premier league at the end of this season — and it is by no means certain — then he will leave behind barely a trace . more poor results , more points separating his team from champions-elect chelsea may cause the ground to shift a little further but any decision regarding the manager will be motivated much more by what happens next rather than what happened over the past eight months . the majority are happy to work and play for him . football director txiki begiristain has been largely responsible for this and his contribution , at least that which we can see , has been disappointing given the reputation earned at barcelona .
