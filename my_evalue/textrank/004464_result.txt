jake shaw was just beginning his gap year - volunteering as a climbing instructor at kandersteg international scout centre - when the tragedy occurred last year . after consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at kandersteg international scout centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a ' very drunk state ' . although jake was taken from us at only 21 , they were great years and jake was fortunate to have had so many marvellous experiences and done so much in his life .
