we all need a helping hand sometimes , and nobody more so than kecil the baby orangutan , who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him . usually he turned to people for comfort , but instead he ran and cuddled up to maggie . the pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo 's four other orangutans , but at the moment they are living in isolation , as would be the case in the wild . the other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well .
