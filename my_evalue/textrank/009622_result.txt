born-again christian victoria wasteney has launched an appeal after she was given a written warning for praying for a muslim colleague and inviting her to church events . when miss nawaz was upset about health problems , miss wasteney said she offered to pray for her – putting her hand on her knee and asking god for ‘ peace and healing’ . she also invited her to church events and gave her colleague a book , i dared to call him father , about a muslim woman who converts to christianity , but denied she was trying to make miss nawaz convert .
