while the fox appears to have some success fending off a flock of crows , when a pair of eagles turn up he soon finds out he has taken on more than he can handle . mr alexander , of nemuro in japan , said : ' two young steller 's sea eagles and a group of crows were quarrelling which a red fox had also noticed . ' steller sea eagles are large birds of prey which live in coastal areas of north eastern asia . in a contest that quickly turns to two , plus crows , against one , the fox is defeated and left to slink off in search of other discarded bones .
