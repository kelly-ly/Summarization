harry kane should not go to the under-21 european championship with england this summer , instead saving himself for roy hodgson 's first team , according to kenny dalglish . it will just tire him out .

' i don’t think the under-21s is there to win tournaments - although it’s nice if you do , and you don’t want to encourage someone that losing is good . '
