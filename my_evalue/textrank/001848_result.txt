an artist has carved out a unique genre for herself with her colourful portraits of celebrity bottoms . spanish artist catalina viejo , 31 , who is based in new york , paints miniature pictures from candid paparazzi shots rather than using glossy magazine images , and has worked her magic on stars including kim kardashian , katy perry , miley cyrus , rihanna and beyonc√© . katy perry : catalina explains that she wanted to paint her celebrity subjects while they were relaxed or on holiday - not as they are seen in glamorous campaigns . as well as the current exhibit , 30 of the artist 's works are also available in a book under the same title . speaking about the series , catalina said : ' the fact these butts belong to celebrities increases the viewer 's curiosity . ' partly because you feel as if you 're looking at intimate images of people you 're familiar with , but also because of the contradiction created in the context of celebrity .
