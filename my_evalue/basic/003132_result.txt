brelo 's attorney patrick d'angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up chevy malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects ' vehicle . but brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in november 2012 had ample reason to believe that russell and williams were shooting at them , he said . bell said a medical examiner has concluded that brelo fired ' kill shots ' into russell and williams and that they were still alive when brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the malibu , striking williams 11 times and russell six times , when they were no longer a threat to anyone .
