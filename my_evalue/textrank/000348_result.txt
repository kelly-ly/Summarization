in march , a `` mad men '' bench was unveiled in front of new york 's time & life building , where the fictional firm of sterling cooper & partners has its headquarters . the old orders are falling apart : white-shoe wasp firms like sterling cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as doyle dane bernbach ; grimy new york replaced by sunny los angeles ; the `` good war '' generation butting heads with the `` make love , not war '' cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid-state ibm world . though the agency survived , it 's now without bert cooper ( robert morse ) and under the ownership of ( real-life ) madison avenue titan mccann erickson .
