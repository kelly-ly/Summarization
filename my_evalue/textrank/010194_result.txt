if not properly explained and accounted for , they may skew the reliability of climate models and lead to over-interpretation of short-term temperature trends . the research , uses observed data , rather than the more commonly used climate models , to estimate decade-to-decade variability . ' at any given time , we could start warming at a faster rate if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase without any offsetting changes in aerosol concentrations or natural variability , ' said wenhong li , assistant professor of climate at duke , who conducted the study with brown . infectious diseases , such as ebola and west nile virus , will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming . the team examined whether climate models , such as those used by the ipcc , accurately account for natural chaotic variability that can occur in the rate of global warming . to test these , created a new statistical model based on reconstructed empirical records of surface temperatures over the last 1,000 years . ' by comparing our model against theirs , we found that climate models largely get the ' big picture ' right but seem to underestimate the magnitude of natural decade-to-decade climate wiggles , ' brown said .
