in the previews for bruce jenner 's much-anticipated interview with diane sawyer , he said that his whole life has been getting him ready for this moment - and truly , the olympian 's changing looks over the years most certainly seem to have been building up to some kind of dramatic transformation . since achieving fame in 1976 , when he won olympic gold in the men 's decathlon , bruce , now 65 , has notoriously undergone countless cosmetic procedures , from multiple nose jobs to the shaving down of his adam 's apple , many of which - including a revisionary face lift - have been documented as part of his well-known reality series keeping up with the kardashians . during the first few years of his marriage to kris , bruce 's appearance remained much the same , although he would sometimes let his hair grow out a bit longer , which only served to draw more attention to the numerous cosmetic surgeries bruce is known to have undergone during this time .
