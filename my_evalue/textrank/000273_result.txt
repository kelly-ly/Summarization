as migrants , libyans are fewer in number , but libya ( 1912-1941 ) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for italy . libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of italy , on the model of french algeria , and libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship 's persecution of those who resisted italian occupation . this political intervention did not spell the end of italian-libyan commercial dealings , which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made libya italy 's biggest oil supplier . since 2004 , italy and libya have been directly connected by the greenstream natural gas pipeline , which runs below the mediterranean , on the same axis as many migrant boats .
