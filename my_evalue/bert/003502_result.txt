an unknown englishman playing in his first pga tour event will have the chance to complete an unbelievable fairytale at the shell houston open on sunday and earn the most unlikely invitation to the masters . this is a real 36 hole lottery where 131 players were fighting for the final four spots . day , however , refused to be overawed as he put together a tidy , bogey-free scorecard to match the 68 shot by casey and upstage rose , who shot 72 . funnily enough , heâ€™s not attracting criticism anymore .
