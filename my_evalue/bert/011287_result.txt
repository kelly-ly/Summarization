chamali fernando , candidate for cambridge , was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the comment . silly ideas like making people suffering from mental health issues wear wristbands would only increase the discrimination and stigma around mental health , rather than end it . ' i hope chamali regrets her comments and will think carefully about her attitude to mental illness in the future . ' it was not that they should wear a wristband .
