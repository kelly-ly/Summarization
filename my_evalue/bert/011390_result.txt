jaap stam had just ordered a new kitchen for his cheshire home when he was informed by sir alex ferguson that he was being sold to lazio . the then manchester united manager didnâ€™t mention in the same conversation that his son , jason , stood to make a seven-figure sum in his role as an agent in the deal . sterling might be 20 and he might want what seems a ludicrous amount of money for a player , while hugely promising , remains relatively unproven . just as they should realise that switching to a club like manchester city might not be the smartest move at this stage of his development .
