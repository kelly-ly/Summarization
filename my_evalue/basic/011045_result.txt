on each board , one of the squares is a slightly different shade of the same colour and the aim is to find this odd square by tapping it with your finger or clicking it with the mouse . although the game appears relatively simple , and starts with a board of just four coloured squares , it quickly grows to a board of up to 81 squares . on the desktop version the game lets you continue until the timer runs out , but on the mobile apps ( pictured ) players ca n't progress until they have scored more than 20 on each level .
