we have had discussions with the church of christ , scientist and have formed the view that this exemption is no longer current or necessary and will therefore be removed , ' minister morrison said . ' having been informed the religion is not advising members to avoid vaccinating their children and following engagement with members , the government no longer sees that the exemption is current and the authorisation for this exemption has been withdrawn . ' having resolved this outstanding matter the government will not be receiving nor authorising any further vaccination exemption applications from religious organisations . ' the only authorised exemption from being required to have children immunised in order to receive benefits is on medical grounds . ' while parents have the right to decide to not vaccinate their children , if they are doing so as a vaccination objector , they are no longer eligible for assistance from the australian government . ' minister for social services scott morrison has announced the end to religious exemption on childrenâ€™s vaccinations for access to childcare benefits . the announcement comes after mr morrison said while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society , it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money . ' we 're a free country , and we 're for free society , but that does n't mean you get to take taxpayers ' money if you do n't want to go along with the rules . ' while doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated , some immunisation experts are worried the move wo n't bolster immunisation rates .
