researchers sketching out a ' wiring diagram ' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the internet . the discovery is the result of a massive , labor-intensive effort to organize 40 years ' worth of data from peer-reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains . ' swanson believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies — which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans — and rat brain studies , which can be more in-depth . ' having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies , ' swanson said . '
