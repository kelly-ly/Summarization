benaud was first and foremost a television broadcaster , a man of unusually wry wit who once responded on air to colleague chris broad’s malapropism ( ‘ honestly , you run out of expletives when describing the fielding of jonty rhodes’ ) without skipping a beat : ‘ which particular one did you have in mind ? ’ but benaud also penned a regular column for the news of the world , taking his place among the hacks – not all tv men take the trouble – to craft his copy whenever a test match was going on . benaud was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . ‘ above all , ’ he told wisden , ‘ when commentating , don’t take yourself too seriously , and have fun . ’ benaud was australia captain and the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests .
