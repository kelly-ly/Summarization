( cnn ) would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant , long-deceased relative who had owned slaves ? i would n't , and neither did ben affleck , who lobbied producers of a pbs show , `` finding your roots , '' to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather benjamin cole , a georgia slave owner in the mid-1800 's , in an episode that looked at affleck 's family history . here 's the thing that might surprise many , given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material : the show 's producer , harvard professor henry louis gates jr. , apparently acquiesced to affleck 's request , because when the episode aired in october 2014 , there was no mention of the star 's slave-owning ancestor .
