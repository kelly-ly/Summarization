if andrew strauss becomes england’s new supremo , the comeback hopes of kevin pietersen , which gained momentum with the sacking of paul downton , would come to an abrupt halt . strauss said on saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages pietersen sent to south african opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago . ‘it’s very important for english cricket to move on from the kevin pietersen situation , ’ said strauss , who infamously called pietersen ‘ a complete c***’ on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off .
