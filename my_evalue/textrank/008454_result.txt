everton striker romelu lukaku dealt with racism as a youngster by using it as an added motivation to score goals . but i just responded by scoring goals . there were some games where i used to play down the sides , it did n't work out for me , ' lukaku told the liverpool echo . ' in all the games when i 've played as a striker i have scored goals so when the manager switched over with two strikers with arouna , that was heaven for me because i could do whatever i wanted because there was somebody next to me who had a work ethic the same as me .
