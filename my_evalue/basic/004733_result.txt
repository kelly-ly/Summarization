innocent victims : al qaeda hostages dr warren weinstein ( left ) , a 73-year-old economic adviser from the us , and 39-year-old italian aid worker giovanni lo porto ( right ) were killed in a botched drone strike in january , which us officials say could have been postponed had it not been for a relaxed drone policy . president obama , seen here april 23 addressing the death of the two captives , reportedly has granted cia a waiver exempting the agency from providing proof of imminent threat to the us ahead of planned drone strikes . without obama 's waiver , cia operatives would have been forced to gather additional information and surveillance data on the al qaeda-linked militants targeted in the january 15 strike , which may have delayed it , possibly sparing the lives of dr warren weinstein , a 73-year-old economic adviser from the us , and 39-year-old italian aid worker giovanni lo porto .
