the daughter of chicago socialite sheila von wiese-mack accused of brutally murdering her mother during a bali vacation will turn over a ' significant percentage ' of her $ 1.3million trust fund to care for her newborn daughter . cbs reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to stella , who was born in kerobakan prison and who has urgent needs , including clothing and baby wipes . mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime .
