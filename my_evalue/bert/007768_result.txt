beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at victoria 's picturesque rye beach last week - a swimming echidna ! the prickly australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the mornington peninsula , 83 km south of melbourne . the video of the swimming echidna , which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel , was posted online by youtube user emma b . according to australia zoo , echidnas , like many native australian animals , are actually ' proficient ' swimmers .
