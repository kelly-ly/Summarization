john helm was commentating on bradford city’s game against lincoln city when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day . what i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as martin fletcher has done with his book fifty-six , the story of the bradford fire . without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time stafford heginbotham , there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased heginbotham . a memorial at valley parade pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago .
