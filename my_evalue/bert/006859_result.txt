when running , a change in the speed of a track on your playlist can throw your pace completely out of sync . songs are played in full but users can skip tracks if they want to . once installed the free app uses the phone 's accelerometer to track the user 's stride , it then searches for songs in the spotify library with matching beats per minute . after the trial expires they can then upgrade to spotify premium or use their local music library to generate the running playlists .
