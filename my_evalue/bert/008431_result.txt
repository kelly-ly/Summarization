these eerie photographs show the inside of an abandoned 19th century victorian asylum which has lay dormant for 20 years . opened in 1818 , the asylum once housed nearly 1,000 patients and expands over 350 metres in length overlooking the town of stafford in the west midlands . dysentery and syphilis were said to have been commonplace at the now run down asylum ( as pictured in 1940 right ) where suicide cages were erected in the stairwells after a female patient threw herself off the fourth floor . in need of a makeover : the asylum is now set to be transformed into 102 apartments .
