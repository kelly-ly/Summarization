unless you 're born with kate moss ' cheekbones or karlie kloss ' endless legs , making it as a model in the fast-paced and fickle world of fashion is no mean feat - and something liris crosse knows all about . liris crosse always dreamed of being a model but had a tough time breaking into the industry with many people telling her to lose weight to succeed - but the size 18 model ( us 14 ) proved them wrong . essence , honey , xxl , the source and black elegance magazines were the first to believe in her vision . i also want to get back more into my acting career because i truly believe a plus woman can be a sexy lead on a tv series ... hey hollywood , call me !
