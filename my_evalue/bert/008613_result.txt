on sunday , 36,000 runners took to the streets of london for the 26.2 mile virgin money london marathon . for one couple however , these streets became a 26 mile aisle where they exchanged vows en route . unfortunately paul , 41 , lost his father to bowel cancer 19 years ago and so by running this weekend 's marathon , the couple have raised Â£7,000 so far to help honour his memory on this special day . laura and paul ran the first half of the marathon separately before meeting half way round at st katharine docks for the ceremony which was witnessed by 80 guests .
