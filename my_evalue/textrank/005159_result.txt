speaking about the origins of the glittering event , keszler told femail : ' life ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80’s and early 90’s - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw aids as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying , but that no one understood or was willing to talk about . ' he concludes : ' life ball is symbolic , it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world’s most significant aids organisations come together , stand together , fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves . ' it is my constant desire for life ball weekend to expand , to obtain more friends , have better connections , help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social aids as well as the disease itself .
