mohammad liaqat launched into a ' racist tirade ' after mount carmel school headteacher xavier bowers ( pictured ) banned muslim pupils from growing beards . after being arrested , liaqat was told to stay away from the school , so went to another school nearby where he continued his rant . after being taught in isolation for breaking the school rules , mount carmel governors decided that the students could keep their beards so long as they signed up to a programme at their mosque to show their faith . liaqat was causing problems , which led to the headteacher asking him to leave the premises .
