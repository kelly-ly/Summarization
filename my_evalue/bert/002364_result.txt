not every greek island lets you rent a boat and potter about at will , but skopelos does . the rope sank fast . with no airport , most people fly to skiathos , followed by an hour 's ferry ride . up a steep hill from skopelos town , and along a dirt track ( vehicle needed ) lies villa thea , with its cool stone floors , pool and large terrace .
