a breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power , scientists claim . water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water , respectively . their catalyst , placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen , is much more efficient - and although dr hintermair didn’t have an exact figure , he said the energy loss using it is ‘ almost non-existent’ . solar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the uk 's electricity by the end of the decade ( wymeswold solar farm in leicestershire , uk shown ) , but storing it is difficult .
