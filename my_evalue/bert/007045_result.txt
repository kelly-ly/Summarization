apology : clydesdale chief debbie crosbie whose rogue staff misled the financial ombudsman . in one case a married couple were cheated out of a £5,100 pay-out because the lender lied to the ombudsman that it had not been able to trace records of them having bought ppi . the fact that clydesdale misled the financial ombudsman by providing false information about the information it held is particularly serious and this is reflected in the size of the fine . ’ these practices were not authorised or condoned by the banks .
