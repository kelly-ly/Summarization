( cnn ) two years ago in a less turbulent time , mike premeau and kathy danke launched a small business , memories gourmet pizza co. , in their wisconsin town . and almost overnight , premeau and danke found themselves thrust unwillingly into a national debate over indiana 's controversial religious freedom restoration act . premeau thinks the firestorm was sparked by people googling `` memories pizza '' and confusing the two businesses -- despite the fact that nichols and walkerton are in separate states and almost 300 miles apart . he and danke tried to defuse the outcry with a facebook post saying in part , `` we are not that company in indiana , nor do we agree or condone their words or actions .
