the pm was speaking in a rather peculiar building – an almost empty science park on the city’s outskirts , its round atrium area filled with party activists . mr cameron was appearing alongside george osborne , chancellor of the exchequer , both of them in weekday suits . mr cameron had spent the morning in poole , dorset ( where veteran lib dem mp annette brooke is retiring ) and apparently ate a hot dog while he was there .
