the smaller size of the vessels means not only a more intimate on-board experience - as in tv 's cheers bar , it can become a place where everybody who serves you soon knows your name - it also means the ships can access ports off-limits to the bigger vessels . i boarded our seven-night azamara quest cruise from monaco to rome with a sense of great expectations : i anticipated a friendly ambience , great service and some interesting ports . famous for its salt pans , porto vecchio offered another treat - the azamazing evening ( there is one on every cruise ) , a large , free-of-charge party with masses of food , wine and entertainment laid on at a nearby beach that we reached in a fleet of coaches .
