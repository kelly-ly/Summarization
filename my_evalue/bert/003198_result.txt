two armed robbers have been caught on camera using a sledgehammer and an axe to try and smash their way into a jewellery shop . one of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at uncle jewellers and pawn brokers . when a worker barricaded the door and pushed one of them back through the broken window they fled the scene , threatening a member of the public with the axe as they did so . it caused a lot of commotion and i have no doubt there are lots of potential witnesses who saw what happened and could have vital information for us .
