kansas is one signature away from telling poor families that it 's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol , tobacco and pornography , to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops , and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races . the proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback 's policies , including one that requires ' temporary cash assistance ' recipients to hold down jobs , look for work or enroll in job training programs . no benefits : a pending kansas law would make it illegal for welfare recipients to spend their government-supplied stipends at strip clubs , among a laundry list of other places .
