( cnn ) robert downey jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a british journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie downey was there to promote . the journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and `` dark periods '' of addiction and jail time . from the start of the 7-minute television interview , it seems evident that downey is not particularly interested in being there , even if being there was , ultimately , a benefit to him -- after all , he 's promoting his latest film , `` avengers : age of ultron .
