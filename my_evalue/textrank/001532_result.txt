i 'm not going to be on the golf course this week thinking maybe let 's try this shot because i 'll have it next week on the 12th or on the 15th or something like that . i 'm going to be focused on what i want to achieve here and then when sunday finishes then i can concentrate on next week . ' i wanted to try it again this year and hopefully i 'll do better next week , too . ' spaniard garcia plays out of the trees by the 11th hole at augusta during the masters in 2013 .
