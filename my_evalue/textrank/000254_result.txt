it is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and ngo workers . they are now empty , the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables . drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps , holding their children , hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of america 's war here .
