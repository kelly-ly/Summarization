for more stars to form in environments like the pillars of creation , it is a race against time as intense radiation from the powerful stars that are already shining continues to grind away at the pillars . by measuring the pillars of creation 's rate of evaporation , muse has given astronomers a time frame for when the pillars will be no more . the pillars of creation are a classic example of the column-like shapes that develop in the giant clouds of gas and dust that are the birthplaces of new stars . the columns arise when immense , freshly formed blueâ€“white o and b stars give off intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds that blow away less dense materials from their vicinity .
