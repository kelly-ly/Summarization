in its turbulent 800 year history , hay castle has been besieged , set ablaze and become a frequent target for marauding welsh rebels . the damage is caused by their larvae , which burrow inside the wood , weakening them as they go . it is said to be associated with the vigil kept beside dying people . the castle was since the 1960s owned by richard booth , the bookseller whose antics turned hay on wye in a ‘ town of books’ and venue for a famous literary festival , until it was purchased in 2011 by the hay castle trust .
