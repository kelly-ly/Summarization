( cnn ) i 'm haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer . what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while slager appears to plant an item next to his body . if slager had been wearing a body camera , scott would probably still be alive , and slager would n't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence .
