there were a lot of potential managers in the arsenal team that patrick vieira captained but he , more than anybody , looked destined to be a top boss . i met him for a tour of cityâ€™s new training ground recently and the respect he commands at that club is incredible . he is a model professional but he has the personality and presence to take charge in a dressing-room full of big egos . it can be done .
