scottish first minister nicola sturgeon has hit out at people questioning why she does n't have children â€“ and claimed she would never be asked if she was a man . i 'll make the most of that and do the best i can for the people i serve because ultimately i am a public servant and the people are the boss . ' ms sturgeon dismissed the ifs report as ' full of assumptions and speculations ' , adding that the think tank had got ' the snp 's plans wrong ' . the first minister continued : ' secondly , it gives no credit for the revenue we would increase from cracking down on tax avoidance ... but the fundamental misassumption at the heart of the ifs report this morning is this one : it assumes that the snp would cut borrowing by 2019/20 to 1.4 % of gdp .
