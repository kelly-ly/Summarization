a hilarious manufacturing mistake means some police officers will have the word ' police ' written upside down on their uniforms . chairman of the hampshire police federation burst out laughing when he saw the uniform and posted a photograph of it online . i then spoke to an another officer who said he was given one which was exactly the same . ' embarrassing : mr apter said the officers will only wear the uniforms ' internally ' and not when they are patrolling ( pictured the right way round ) the area .
