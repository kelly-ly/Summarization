before we had even touched down , i knew i was visiting somewhere unique . miles of prayer flags lined the runway and instead of a soulless modern airport , the terminal had whitewashed walls and carved casement windows painted with ornate motifs . massive dzongs , medieval monastic fortresses , tower over the valleys and shrines containing gilded prayer wheels are dotted across the hillsides . prayer flags decorate many place sin the religious country which measures its success with a gross national happiness index .
