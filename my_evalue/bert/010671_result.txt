a lobster restaurant in canada has issued a detailed and sincere apology after it was attacked by online commenters for a ban on ' small screaming children ' . would n't grace their doors if they paid me . the restaurant later posted an apology on the page , saying that the ' hate and threats ' the owner had received had prompted him to reconsider his policy . i know some may find this silly but i love cape breton and moved home to give back .
