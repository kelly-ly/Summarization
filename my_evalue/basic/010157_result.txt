north sea cod stocks are bouncing back after being heavily overfished for decades and could even be sustainable in five years , new research has found . consumers were previously told to eat gurnard instead of cod after stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s , but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006 . however the findings by seafish and the marine stewardship council ( msc ) revealed that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably , with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management .
