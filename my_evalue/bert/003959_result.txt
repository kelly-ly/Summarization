it is easy to understand the distaste that so many feel for floyd mayweather jr . debates aimed at placing that crown on one head are , essentially , specious but it is legitimate to claim that mayweather is one of the best ever . boxing has always venerated the artist and swooned over practitioners of the sweet science and mayweather personifies so much of what the purists admire . mayweather is not a crowd-pleaser .
