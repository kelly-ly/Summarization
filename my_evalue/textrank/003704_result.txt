the 50-year-old dutchman has six games to save his new side from relegation into sky bet league two , with the magpies currently one point from safety . the league one club have confirmed that dave kevan will be moniz 's assistant at meadow lane . results , of course , are the yardstick by which managers are ultimately judged , but if we can play the sort of football that gets people off their seats and instil in our players the desire to take games to our opponents , i think we can make a real impression in this division .
