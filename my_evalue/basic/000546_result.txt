los angeles ( cnn ) former rap mogul marion `` suge '' knight was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic `` straight outta compton '' earlier this year . in all , knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run , the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended thursday . the judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because california law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle knight was driving , is used against several people .
