president barack obama and cuban president raul castro shook hands last night ahead of a historic meeting which may see cuba declassified as a state sponsor of terrorism . apart from a couple of brief , informal encounters , the leaders of the united states and cuba have not had any significant meetings since the castro brothers toppled u.s.-backed dictator fulgencio batista and then steered their caribbean country into a close alliance with the soviet union . while obama 's policy has been widely praised around latin america , this was tempered last month when his administration imposed sanctions on venezuela , cuba 's closest ally and main benefactor . that controversy now hangs over the summit this weekend .
