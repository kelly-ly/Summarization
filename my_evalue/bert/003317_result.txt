battleground : esther mcvey , who won her wirral west seat in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436 , has demanded that ed miliband condemns the attacks . i believe it is right that we have a conservative mp up here who is sitting at the table at cabinet , so their underhand tactics won’t bully and intimidate me . ’ miss mcvey , who was given a job in the cabinet by david cameron last july , said that she is one of a number of women sat around the table who knows how to have her voice heard and shows the party is not solely made up of women in ‘twin-sets and pearls’ . theresa may was chairman of the party when i came in .
