this concept of `` how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets , '' was what drove photographer simon brann thorpe to begin his project `` toy soldiers . '' thorpe said his project enables `` the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional , physical and political response to war and conflict , when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers . '' thorpe 's background was not in photojournalism , but in landscape photography , which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between morocco and the polisario front .
