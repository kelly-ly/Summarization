this combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle , causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , pictured , and solar flares that can endanger earth . researchers can turn to advanced computer simulations and more detailed observations to learn more about the profound influence of the bands on solar activity . dr mcintosh said this could be assisted by a proposed network of satellites observing the sun , much as the global networks of satellites around earth have helped advance terrestrial weather models since the 1960s . ' if you understand what the patterns of solar activity are telling you , you 'll know whether we 're in the stormy phase or the quiet phase in each hemisphere , ' dr mcintosh said .
