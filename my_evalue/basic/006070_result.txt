the football association chairman admits his organisation’s response to former west bromwich albion striker jeff astle’s death aged 59 in 2002 , from ‘ industrial disease’ linked to repetitive head injuries sustained playing football , was ‘ woefully inadequate’ . the fa and pfa promised a 10-year study to investigate the connection between head injuries and early on-set dementia after a coroner found astle’s brain ‘ resembled that of a boxer’s’ but a mail on sunday investigation last year revealed the research was never carried out . dyke went to the hawthorns on saturday for the launch of the jeff astle foundation , which aims to raise awareness of head injuries in football while funding future research , and he apologised for the fa’s failure to acknowledge the significance of astle’s death .
