there will be calls for england to get rid of alastair cook and jonathan trott on the back of their failures here but i think they should both play all three tests against west indies before any sort of decision is made . and it is true to say he has been found out . now opponents are bowling at him in the areas he doesnâ€™t want them to and he has a problem when the ball is moving . but the swinging ball is not a new phenomenon , especially to an opener brought up in england , and cook has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his test career .
