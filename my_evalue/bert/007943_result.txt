as any parent will know , children 's feet will often grow faster than it is possible to buy them new shoes to keep them shod . the shoe that grows ( pictured ) has adjustable points at the front , sides and the back of the sandal to help it expand . kenton lee , from nampa , idaho , came up with the idea while working in nairobi in kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small . poppers on the size allow the width to be adjusted as the child 's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer .
