the new winner of masterchef simon wood , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson . everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self-taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows . while simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven .
