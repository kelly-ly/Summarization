a red hot novak djokovic is being tipped to end rafa nadal 's stranglehold at roland garros in june but the spaniard dismissed the threat as being no different to those he has faced before . he comfortably beat nadal on his beloved red clay in last week 's monte carlo masters semi-finals , and the nature of djokovic 's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first french open . djokovic was good in 2011 , in 2012 , 2013 as well as in 2015 .
