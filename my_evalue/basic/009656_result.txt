some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation . a composite of 18 images showing off the comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko activity from different angles as seen between 31 january ( top left ) and 25 march ( bottom right ) , when the spacecraft was at distances of about 30 to 100 km from the comet . if comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko is representative of all cometary nuclei , then we suggest that magnetic forces are unlikely to have played a role in the accumulation of planetary building blocks greater than one meter ( 3 feet ) in size .
