the creator of the best-selling alex rider spy novels has accused fellow children’s author david walliams of dumbing-down fiction and failing to ‘challenge’ young readers . anthony horowitz said books by the comedian – who was the uk’s top-selling children’s author last year – are ‘ witty and entertaining’ but nowhere near ambitious enough . he added : ‘ to some extent , narrative fiction was reinvented by jk rowling – it’s hard to believe that children weren’t challenged by books that stretched to 760 pages – and a phalanx of writers crested on her success : michael morpurgo , philip pullman , jacqueline wilson , malorie blackman , eoin colfer , darren shan ... and me . ' the success of his books , which also include ratburger and billionaire boy , has also been boosted by television adaptations , such as the boy in the dress , which starred walliams , meera syal and jennifer saunders , and was shown on the bbc at christmas .
