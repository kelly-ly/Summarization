a footballer died in a freak accident when he slid off the pitch after being tackled and slammed his head on the clubhouse wall . as mr hiscox crossed the ball into the box , he was tackled by the defender and hit the floor . the player had been part of the amateur club since he was a teenager . he was not only a great goal scorer , but a great guy - if you were feeling down he would cheer you up .
