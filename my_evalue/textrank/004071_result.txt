he said a labour government would give workers the right to demand a ' regular contract if they do regular hours ' after three months . mr miliband said workers should be given the right after 12 weeks to demand ' a regular contract if they do regular hours ' . john cridland , cbi director-general , added : ' the uk 's flexible jobs market has given us an employment rate that is the envy of other countries , so proposals to limit flexible contracts to 12 weeks are wide of the mark . ' of course action should be taken to tackle abuses , but demonising flexible contracts is playing with the jobs that many firms and many workers value and need . '
