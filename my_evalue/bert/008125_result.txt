in an effort to counter rival netflix 's entry into the australian market , cable tv 's foxtel will launch the third season of the critically acclaimed us women 's prison drama orange is the new black by screening every episode in a full season marathon . the established prison drama is currently one of netflix 's flagship tv shows . the popular tv series is based on the book of the same name , by piper kerman , about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth . the upshot is that orange is the new black must now compete as a drama at this year 's emmy awards , a move which means the series will compete directly against netflix 's other flagship show house of cards .
