most people would run away if they saw a pile of soil and rubble creeping towards them as if it had a life of its own . as the earthflow moves down a slope , it remains covered with any vegetation and typically leaves a bowl-shaped depression behind . they are usually triggered by heavy rainfall , so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water , it starts flowing downhill . the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope , varying from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid , as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked in a matter of minutes .
