tracey neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers . it might explain why it is tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first , taking england 's netball team to this summer 's world cup in australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting . these days i 'm working with girls who are doctors , lawyers , zoologists . ' but i think i 'm a better coach than i ever was a player .
