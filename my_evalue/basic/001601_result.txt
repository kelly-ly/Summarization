kalman kallai enjoyed the spectacular canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from borden , ontario to comox , british columbia for work purposes . calculating that the drive would take him across a colossal 2,796 miles ( 4500km ) of land , mr kallai believed that his journey would be more interesting if he used it as an opportunity to see more of his country . after picking up a green rocking chair that he acquired for free from online advertisement site kijiji , the traveller attached his trailer and set off on the nine-day journey .
