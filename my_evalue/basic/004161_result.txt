brendan rodgers insists liverpool’s transfer ambitions will not be compromised by their inability to offer champions league football – as they step up their pursuit of memphis depay . psv are looking for £25million for depay , who has also been linked with bayern munich , and while rodgers would neither confirm nor deny liverpool’s interest , he did acknowledge it is players of depay’s quality he is aiming to attract . rodgers does not intend to be as busy as last year when he made eight new signings – burnley’s danny ings and james milner of manchester city are prime targets , while aston villa striker christian benteke could be an option – but depay is a marker of their ambitions .
