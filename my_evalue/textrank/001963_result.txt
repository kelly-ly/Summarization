it is believed the man , whose nickname is ' che ' , was struck by a huge falling icicle , causing a collection of blood under the skin called a haemotoma . in the original film , which has been edited by mailonline , the man is seen making a deep incision into his leg with a scalpel , and blood is seen flowing out . he cuts a deep incision in his own leg using a scalpel , which he sterilised by heating it with a gas lamp . using his own hands he scoops out blood which has coagulated and formed a clot , before sewing the wound up with surgical string .
