britain 's public schools are now the very image of tradition but behind their establishment image lies a history of rebellion and revolution . a new book by former education journalist david turner , the old boys , lays bare the little-known history . the frequent violence and the outmoded classics-based education at the schools nearly undid them . a number of modern days figures are name checked in the book including mumford and sons from kingâ€™s college with david cameron providing inspiration for the text .
