relegation to the national league – the grand-sounding new title for the conference but do n't be fooled – may partly be down to prenton park legend and ex-manager ronnie moore , sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence , and now masterminding hartlepool 's unlikely survival . and it could all happen under the ownership of former fa chief executive mark palios , knowledgeable football man and esteemed former tranmere player who took over the club late last summer . barnet , who lead the conference by one point , have a home game against mid-table gateshead on saturday while rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom alfreton , who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated .
