details of its algorithm are included in their paper , bodyprint : biometric user identification on mobile devices using the capacitive touchscreen to scan body parts . they claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year , based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day . ' recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords , making authentication more convenient for users , ' explained the researchers . ' however , due to their cost , capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones , a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor . ' this allows the touch sensor ' to scan usersâ€™ body parts , such as ears , fingers , fists , and palms by pressing them against the display . ' to accept an incoming call , users would only need to press their ear against the phone . during tests with 12 participants , bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy .
