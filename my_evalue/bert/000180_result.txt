( cnn ) if i had to describe the u.s.-iranian relationship in one word it would be `` overmatched . '' iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that america 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track . and in one of the cruelest ironies , iran 's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah : the nuclear issue . washington does n't play this kind of game well .
