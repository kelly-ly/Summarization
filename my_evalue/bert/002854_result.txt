a hospital in western australia is in hot water after blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments . the company was fined $ 60,000 and was subject to department of health workers auditing its staff , but the hospital has been found of continuing to operate with poorly sanitised instruments , reports abc . so this gives us great concerns . i ca n't imagine how people must feel if they 've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage , ' he said .
