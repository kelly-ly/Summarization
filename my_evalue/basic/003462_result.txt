when high-energy electrons and ions from the sun hit earth’s upper atmosphere , they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras . the intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras – and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere . the accelerator would be located in space , 185 miles ( 300km ) above the ground , and would fire back towards earth 's atmosphere .
