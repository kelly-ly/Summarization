police arrested 12 protesters thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of mauna kea where one of the world 's largest telescopes is being built . while the native hawaiian groups do not oppose the thirty meter telescope itself , they disagree with the location of the construction on mauna kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities . the university sub-leases the land atop mauna kea for the telescope project , and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws , he said .
