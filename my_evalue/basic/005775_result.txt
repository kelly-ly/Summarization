sauntering down leafy avenues past typical dutch step-Â­gabled buildings , carpets of crocuses , the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal , i can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than the hague . this is also the home of girl with a pearl earring , the ' dutch mona lisa ' . much more than a village : the parliament building stands proud in the hague - a hidden gem of a city .
