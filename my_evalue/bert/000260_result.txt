( cnn ) last month wu rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on international women 's day against sexual harassment in china . the timing of the detentions of china 's most inventive women 's rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women 's achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women 's rights . they staged small , public `` performance art '' protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women 's rights movement , and pushed women 's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government 's agenda . perhaps this is what the government finds threatening : that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times .
