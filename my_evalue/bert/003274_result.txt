the wi has been told it must pay the royal albert hall thousands of pounds if it wants to serve the cakes to 5,000 women attending centenary celebrations at the venue in june . we can’t waste money on this . but organisers were astonished to be told that the gesture would incur a ‘ sampling charge’ of £2,500 because the centenary cake has fallen foul of the hall’s sponsorship rules . even though the fruitcake has been home-made by two wi star bakers , some of the ingredients were donated by companies including dairy crest , diageo and whitworths , and their contribution is acknowledged on the cake boxes .
