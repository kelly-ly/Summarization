when it comes to yoghurt lids there are typically three types of people : the ' licker ' , the ' spooner ' who scrapes the remaining yoghurt back into the pot , and the ' waster ' who throws it away . yoghurts in morinaga 's product line can be opened and the lids peeled off without any liquid left on the surface . these bumps increase the contact angle at which droplets touch the surface , which in turn force the droplets to form into spheres . the bumps also create pockets that push air up .
