royal bank of scotland has racked up £50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another ‘ tough year’ . rbs was also hit with a £453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the us . lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector , but the losses at rbs suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis . the disgraced former boss of rbs , fred goodwin , was among those courted by former prime ministers tony blair and gordon brown .
