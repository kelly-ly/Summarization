speaking during a visit to hartlepool , mr farage said : ''the biggest racism i have seen in british politics is happening north of the border where some of the anti-english hatred is reaching a truly astonishing level . 't‎he snp are openly racist . if my supporters behaved in the way that some of those pro-independence supporters behaved in the referendum i 'd have been painted out to be the worst person that had been seen for 70 years in british politics . ' asked if being anti-english was the same as being racist , mr farage said : ' when i say that i do n't think we should have an open door to poland , latvia and lithuania i 'm accused of being racist i think it is ironic that all the talk about extremism within british politics is pointed towards ukip when there are others who are far more guilty . ' asked if nicola sturgeon was also to blame , mr farage added : ' she has n't done anything to stop it , but i have n't heard her say anything to encourage it.‎ ' but snp msp humza yousaf hit back at the ukip leader 's ' politics of fear and intolerance ' .
