while sunseekers across britain have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine , the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in scotland hoping to catch sight of shooting stars . this incredible image was captured above pitcaple in aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer graeme whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the lyrid meteor shower . scroll down for video . the strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour , but in 1982 americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour .
