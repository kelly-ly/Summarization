a four-year-old boy got trapped in an arcade game after climbing in to the ' claw ' machine when he failed to win a teddy . he had picked the teddy up with the claw and it had dropped with the teddy 's leg hanging over the edge . he was in there for a good half an hour . ' i 'm worried he 's going to do it again to get another toy because it really did n't bother him .
