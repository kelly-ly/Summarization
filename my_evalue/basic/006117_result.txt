peter thurston , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the ' catamavan ' , out on the river swale in kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside . he says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising , and he could n't buy a bigger vessel , so two years ago he built the caravan boat to take his mind off his recent divorce . mr thurston said : ' i wanted something that had a nice , stable platform and was really comfortable because all my boats are quite cramped .
