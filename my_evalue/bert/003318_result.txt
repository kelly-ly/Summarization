second homeowners face being hit with double rates of council tax under lib dem plans to protect rural life . that seems to me to be fair and , i have to say to you , i suspect people who own second homes here - many of whom have significant means - would like to chip in a bit extra so that they know that , even though they are not living in a community all the time , they are nonetheless supporting the local services that local people do rely upon . ' the measure forms part of a ' countryside charter ' being launched by the lib dems , with mr clegg claiming his party will create 300,000 new jobs in rural areas if it is in government after the general election on may 7 .
