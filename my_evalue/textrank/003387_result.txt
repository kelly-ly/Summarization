the pressure is on carlo ancelotti and real madrid when atletico madrid visit the bernabeu on sunday . that would have been fine had real marked-up a high-scoring draw in the calderon but the 0-0 somehow scraped by atletico madrid last tuesday means that now a draw will not send real madrid through . and of course in among all the bad omens there is one exceptionally positive precedent : in lisbon last may , madrid beat atletico madrid 4-1 and lifted the european cup .
