( cnn ) the complete skeleton of a camel thought to to have been used by ottoman troops besieging vienna in the 17th century has been found beneath a cellar in austria . in their research , published in the journal `` plos one , '' the archaeologists said ottoman troops had besieged the area around tulln in 1683 as they tried to reach vienna , but that tulln itself had never been conquered . apparently , the citizens took it inside the town , where they probably kept and displayed it as an ' exotic animal , ' '' they said . as opposed to the ottoman troops -- who would likely have eaten the camel 's flesh -- the residents of tulln apparently buried the camel whole .
