but german engineers have come up with an innovative solution - a small electric car that can turn on the spot , shrink in size and even move sideways , like a crab , so it can park itself . the concept car can turn on the spot , shrink in size and even move sideways , like a crab , so it can park itself . it pivots using wheels powered by separate motors and shrinks from 8ft ( 2.5metres ) to 5ft ft ( 1.5metres ) crabs ( stock image ) have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the eossc2 works in a similar way .
