the story of poldark highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we weren’t very impressed with aidan turner’s scything.. . mr riley brushed off comparisons with poldark and compared himself to iggy pop instead . mr riley , from gillingham in dorset , also questioned whether turner had been shown how to use a scythe properly before the cameras rolled . ' scything is an efficient and poetic way of cutting rather than the way it was portrayed on poldark where it was this very aggressive , manly action . ' using a scythe should be a sedate , pleasurable activity rather than an arduous , backbreaking chore .
