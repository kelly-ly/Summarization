a fixed-term starter marriage , in which couples sign a renewable contract - known as a 'wedlease'- would work better for many couples , argues susan pease gadoua . a starter marriage is a short-term contract for couples to ' try on ' the institution to see if it fits – without bringing children into the mix – before jumping into a life-long contract , ' mrs pease gadoua said . ' for example , if they want children , they could sign a ' parenting marriage ' contract ( couples should remain childless while in a starter marriage ' because it 's a bad idea to ' try on ' marriage with young lives in the balance ' ) , with new rules and goals .
