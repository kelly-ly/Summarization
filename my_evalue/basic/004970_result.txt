lauren crawley , 54 , a housewife from kings langley , hertfordshire , was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again , as she tells thea jourdan . he explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - i 'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this was n't affected . my eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye , then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place .
