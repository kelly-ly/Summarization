nigel farage has dismissed criticism of the lack of diversity in ukip 's manifesto by claiming there was a ' half black ' party spokesman featured prominently - and ' one fully black person ' . the ukip leader made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and asian faces in the ukip manifesto . mr farage added : ' what they were saying was we 're just about sick to death of the sneering media class trying to make ukip out to be something completely other than it is . ' over 10 % of our candidates come from bme backgrounds .
