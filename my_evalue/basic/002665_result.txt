they worked together to build a model for this ' hybrid spreading ' which accurately predicted patients ' progression from hiv to aids in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off aids . researchers creates a model ' hybrid spreading ' which accurately predicted patients ' progression from hiv to aids in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus . the teams noticed that the spread of hiv through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible .
