a ' rainbow coalition ' made up of several different parties could cause chaos , nick clegg warned today . it predicted the conservatives would end up on 297 seats , only slightly down on 2010 , labour 262 , the snp 35 , liberal democrats 30 , losing almost half of their mps , ukip four and the greens one . mr clegg said the presence of seven leaders in tonight 's election tv debate was an indication of the likelihood that no party would win an outright majority in 2015 . but he insisted that having the lib dems around the cabinet table with either labour or the tories would keep the next government anchored in the centre ground and prevent ed miliband or david cameron ' lurching one way or another ' .
