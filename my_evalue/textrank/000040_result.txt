by sunday , isis said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted iraqi forces remain in full control . it would n't be the first time that militants and iraqi forces have battled over the refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by iraqis domestically . the refinery is just 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from the northern iraqi city of tikrit , which iraqi forces and shiite militias wrested from isis less than two weeks ago .
