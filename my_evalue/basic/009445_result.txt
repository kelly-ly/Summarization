with easter just around the corner we thought it would be helpful to give you a real life gauge on how much cardio you 'll need to put in to get the most out of your easter binge session . after eating only four mini solid chocolate eggs that contain 550 kilojules you 'll need to run for at least 40 minutes to melt the calories away . for those who like their easter with all the trimmings can expect to spend around three and a half hours on the squash court for women and just under three hours for men , before theyâ€™ll be able to burn off a large bunny which adds around 11060 kilojules to your daily calorie intake .
