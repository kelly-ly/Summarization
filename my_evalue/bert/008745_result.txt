has this brilliant 79th masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on sunday ? the other thing spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round . as he made his way down the 15th fairway , first mickelson and then rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures . eight strokes off the pace at the start of play , heâ€™s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today .
