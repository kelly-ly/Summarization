it was just the club 's third home league win of the season , but a fifth successive victory over the magpies , and january signing defoe will have good reason to remember it long after he has finally hung up his boots . the striker wheels away in celebration of his brilliant strike just before the half-time whistle was blown . ' even from when i was young and you do finishing , i have always practised on my left foot because in games , sometimes you get chances and sometimes it comes on your left foot , so i have always practised over the years from when i was very young so i feel comfortable that when a chance comes , i can not even think about it , i can just hit it like i did . ' but at the end of the day , the season has n't finished and we have massive games coming up .
