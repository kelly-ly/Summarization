dick advocaat will welcome ' controller ' lee cattermole back to the heart of his sunderland team as he attempts to launch another late survival bid with a record fifth successive derby victory . the 27-year-old enforcer has missed the last two games through suspension after reaching 10 bookings for the season , and that meant he was unavailable for the dutchman 's first game in charge , a 1-0 defeat at west ham on march 21 . however , cattermole was the only man told he will definitely start against newcastle on sunday during friday 's team meeting , and advocaat is looking for a big response from a player who has once again missed a significant proportion of the campaign to date through injury .
