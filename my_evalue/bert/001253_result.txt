it is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and joe root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last yearâ€™s sydney test . joe root showed plenty of grit , as well as talent , in yet another big innings for england . do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour . i have enjoyed the battle between ben stokes and samuels in this test and i like the way the durham lad goes about his cricket .
