bumping into peter stringfellow in mothercare in palma just over a year ago was not such a big surprise , since we both have houses in majorca where i now live most of the year . i know easyjet has hundreds of planes ; even so , if any reader is flying with them , i would avoid seat 4f , just in case . surprisingly , i have been mistaken for benâ€™s grandfather only twice ( at least to my face ) .
