( cnn ) the death of freddie gray , which was the flashpoint for the protests and now the riots in baltimore , has raised again the questions surrounding police use of force , especially after the now-familiar video of officers arresting mr. gray was arrested by police on april 12 . i suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips , chip clips , etc . according to william murphy , an attorney for gray 's family , he was carrying a `` pocket knife of legal size , '' and the lawyer contended that police did n't see the knife before the altercation .
