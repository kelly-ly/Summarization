( cnn ) just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , youtube channels , even social media platforms like facebook and twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . let 's look at the legal angle first . but it is not just singapore where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in malaysia , with much less of the international attention heaped on amos yee , five editors and executives from the malaysian insider were arrested over the site 's march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the conference of rulers , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under islamic law . because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in vietnam .
