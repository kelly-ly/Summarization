' even if that test had been undertaken , she still would not have been able to have food and water by mouth because of the medical condition , so her treatment was correct , ' dr hames told reporters . ' but mr mcgowan said this was ' part of a pattern of behaviour of the management of fiona stanley hospital ' , adding : ' she could easily have died . '
