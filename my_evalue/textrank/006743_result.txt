chris christie 's wife has quit her big-money job on wall street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016 . may pat christie , 51 , a managing director at new york city finance firm angelo gordon & co , ditched her $ 475,000-a-year position this week , a family spokesman confirmed . but many will see the move as a sign that new jersey governor christie , 52 , is coming closer to seeking the republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election . the move is likely a precursor to christie 's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from mrs christie , pictured above with her husband in new hampshire .
