a moment of madness from england hooker tom youngs handed saracens victory but the second-placed londoners were frustrated by their failure to earn a four-try bonus . with leicester 6-0 up after 37 minutes , youngs was sin-binned for a barge on chris ashton , who had passed the ball to richard wigglesworth and as he tried to return the favour tigers matt smith grabbed it . it is cynical and it was a moment of madness but he does a lot of good things for us . billy vunipola scored after youngs ' exit and marcelo bosch scored after the break .
