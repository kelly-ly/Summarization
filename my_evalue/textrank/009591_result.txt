david cameron ( pictured ) said he knows that when it comes to immigration , ' fears and worries ' remain . do you honestly think ed miliband cares about controlling immigration ? and if you’re someone considering voting ukip because you want a referendum on europe and controlled immigration , remember that a vote for ukip makes it harder for conservatives to win – and much more likely for ed miliband and the snp to get into government .
