the parents of young cancer sufferers now expect to be offered the same treatment as ashya king , one of his doctors has said . clinicians are in an ‘ impossible situation’ as a result of the king family’s flight to spain after disagreeing with doctors who were treating him in the uk . ashya was being treated in southampton when his parents took him from the hospital and fled abroad without telling staff last year . they ignored medical advice and took him to prague for proton beam therapy , ultimately paid for by the nhs trust after he left the uk .
