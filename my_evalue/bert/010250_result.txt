murder-accused teenager heather mack was today given the star treatment in the bali prison where she is being held over her mother 's death . yasona laoly , indonesia’s justice and human rights minister , has offered mack the chance to place the baby with a family to care for the child . it is understood that schaefer - who is facing 18 years in jail after admitting he beat mrs mack about the face and stuffed her body in a suitcase after she allegedly attacked him - has not been made aware of the offer to have the baby he has fathered given to a balinese family . the minister’s compassion for the convicted teenager is at odds with his hard-line stance over the fate of two members of the australian so-called ‘ bali nine’ heroin-smuggling gang .
