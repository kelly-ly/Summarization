a parody video that mocks american skiers and plays on stereotypes about us tourists has gone viral on the internet , but not all viewers are finding it amusing . the comedy sketch follows ' jeff randl ' , who travels to ' sweden ' to compete in xtreme verbier . jeff ( right ) offends others by being loud , jumping queues and smoking marijuana on a gondola . he later takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola , saying : â€˜ hey , this machine is gay .
