last year hawaiian-born photographer dustin wong , 31 , abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company . inspired by ancient hawaiian beliefs in the sacredness of the landscape , dustin wong , 31 , has journeyed from the arctic circle to australia , capturing moments where men and women are alone with the power and splendour of the natural world . i think this way more people will care about protecting and preserving natural environments . ' his journeying in america took in the bonneville salt flats in utah , where the land cracks into spectacular patterns , the grand prismatic spring in yellowstone national park in wyoming , the third largest hot spring in the world whose bright colours are caused by bacteria , to the burning man festival in nevada , which culminates in the burning of a wooden effigy .
