i am not one of those politicians who says they ‘get’ how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private . fake colleges , bogus visas , wide open loopholes , the wrong welfare incentives , sham marriages , an abject failure to deport foreign criminals , migrants bringing family members to britain even if they couldn’t speak a word of english – a litany of failure . on top of all this direct action to control immigration , we recognised that the rising immigration numbers weren’t just about lax borders and a system easily abused ; it was about british people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available – or not incentivised to work at all , because of labour’s welfare system .
