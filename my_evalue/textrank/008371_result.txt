an international panel of scientists will today launch a major inquiry to discover whether official world temperature records have exaggerated the extent of global warming . the panel , convened by the global warming policy foundation ( gwpf ) , the ‘ climate sceptic’ think-tank led by the former tory chancellor lord lawson , will focus on thousands of ‘adjustments’ that have been made to temperature records kept at individual weather stations around the world . the panel will also examine ‘extrapolations’ – when the records include virtual figures from places where there is no actual measuring station , instead basing them on the figures of other stations in the same region .
