a new york city tattoo parlor at the center of a vh1 reality series just got a serving of drama - but not the kind that makes for good publicity . asabi barner told pix 11 that she visited new york last year and decided to stop by the parlor to get a new tattoo to cover up a unicorn and horseshoe piece that she got when she was 18 . barner left the shop happy with her ' phenomenal ' new chest tattoo of fruits and vegetables to represent her career in the culinary industry . in the intimate moments it creates a problem because you donâ€™t have that confidence .
