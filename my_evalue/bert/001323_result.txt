ed miliband is in league with the scottish nationalists and preparing to allow them to be ‘ the chain to labour’s wrecking ball’ , david cameron will say today . the prime minister – who last night said he would be a ‘ big failure’ if he does not win a commons majority – will unveil an analysis to show labour and the snp are ‘ really on the same side’ and want ‘ more borrowing , more debt and more taxes’ . even senior labour figures have doubts over mr miliband’s decision to be the only leader from the main westminster parties to appear with scottish and welsh nationalists , the greens and ukip , putting him in danger of being outflanked on all sides . labour and the scottish nationalists joined forces to oppose government policies to rein in benefits and reward work .
