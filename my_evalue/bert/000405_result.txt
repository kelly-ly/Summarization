west of baghdad , iraq ( cnn ) the call from faleh essawi , the deputy chief of the provincial council , who we were supposed to be meeting up with , came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from baghdad to neighboring anbar province . they think it 's an isis rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the iraqi forces we are with in the hallway , away from the windows . al-janabi , like so many others , is frustrated with the lack of support from baghdad . an ambulance passes us , trying to force its way through the crowds .
