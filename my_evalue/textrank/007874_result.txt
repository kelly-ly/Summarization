the furious backlash against the uk’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare lord janner from the dock . the decision not to charge lord janner last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because mrs saunders said experts agreed that the former leicester west mp was in such poor health due to advanced alzheimer’s disease . lord macdonald said : ‘ it might have been wiser for the cps to say ‘we’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the dpp . ’ further questions also emerged about the true state of lord janner’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the house of lords just a fortnight ago to extend his role .
