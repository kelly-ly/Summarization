( cnn ) anthony ray hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on alabama 's death row for murders he says he did n't commit . hinton , 58 , looked up , took in the sunshine and thanked god and his lawyers friday morning outside the county jail in birmingham , minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985 . but a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case , and the two killings could n't be linked to each other .
