the then manchester united manager didn’t mention in the same conversation that his son , jason , stood to make a seven-figure sum in his role as an agent in the deal . keane would probably feel raheem sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself . he has an agent , in aidy ward , who is developing something of a reputation for an aggressive strategy for his clients – we saw as much when he turned up at old trafford last month with saido berahino – and the approach he is employing here is not exactly endearing sterling to anyone .
