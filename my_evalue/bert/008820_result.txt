james collins can rest easy . his team were 1-0 down against al whidat in the amman derby when their opponents pushed forward , looking to double their lead . or maybe he even mistook his team-mates for opponents . shatnawi kept his eyes on the ball , leaned back , raised his right leg and kicked it over his head , one would imagine in an unorthodox attempt to send the ball over his goal and out for a corner .
