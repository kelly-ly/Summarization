thanks to missions like nasa 's curiosity rover , we know mars once had water - but until now we did n't know how much . scientists have provided the best estimates yet , claiming it once had more water than the arctic ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years . the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on mars to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry .
