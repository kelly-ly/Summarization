kolo toure has warned raheem sterling that leaving liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club , similar to the way that jack rodwell and scott sinclair did at manchester city . sterling stunned liverpool earlier this week , giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new £100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is ' quite flattered ' by interest from arsenal . chelsea and manchester city are also keen on english football 's hottest property . rodwell joined city in a £12million deal in 2012 , while sinclair made the same move from swansea city for an £8m fee later that summer .
