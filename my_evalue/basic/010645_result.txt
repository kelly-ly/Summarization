two ukip council candidates have been taken to school by a teacher who covered their sloppy election leaflet in corrections - but they claim it is a dirty tricks campaign . suzy howlett , 54 , who specialises in teaching foreign-born children english , has embarrassed husband and wife team derek tanswell and sharon snook over their spelling , punctuation and grammar . in one section mr tanswell and ms snook promise that ukip will ' take back control of our boarders ' - so the teacher wrote in red : ' i think you mean borders , not residents of a school or guest house ' .
