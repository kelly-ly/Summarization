somehow , to the backdrop of supporter unrest , protests and a worst-ever start to a premier league season , alan pardew managed to excavate five straight victories from a newcastle side which ranks as their most uninspiring of recent years . from the negativity , however , was born a perverse positivity , driven by pardew’ s determination to repair a reputation so badly stained that his next posting would surely have been outside of the premier league . it has now permeated a playing staff which , like the thousands of supporters who boycotted sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to spurs , have failed to turn up for the best part of 2015 . pardew , of course , was not without some serious flaws , and it was he who presided over six straight losses last season .
