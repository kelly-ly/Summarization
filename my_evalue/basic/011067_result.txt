just knowing that for half the year you can take a dip in the med after work , or sip ros√© on the terrace of a seafront restaurant as the sun sets must be like living in a perpetual mr benn adventure , where you enter the fancy dress shop , trade your suit for a sundress , and walk through the magic door to a beach party . i 've been to a handful of ' beach at the end of the street ' cities in australia and the us , but the only one i know where you walk through cobbled lanes and past gothic palaces to get there is barcelona . an overview of barcelona , the city of contrasting art and architecture with a handy beach alongside it .
