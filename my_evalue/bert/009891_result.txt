it is matches like this that makes one wonder just how good gael monfils could have been ; and perhaps how good he still can be . monfils won a couple of points on serve and the world no 2 was forced to serve to stay in the match at 5-6 . he missed an approach shot wide and the frenchman unfurled that trademark beaming grin . monfils will face grigor dimitrov in what should be an explosive quarter-final .
