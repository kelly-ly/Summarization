cristiano ronaldo left the pitch with a supporter trying to hug him , gareth bale left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after diego godin’s slip . there seems little doubt the man who is fast approaching real’s all-time goals record will finish his playing days as a central striker and he came into this game with a scoring rate of a goal every 74 minutes and seven goals in his last three matches . but neither man could find the finish to give real a vital away goal . bale apologised to ronaldo after one misplaced pass .
