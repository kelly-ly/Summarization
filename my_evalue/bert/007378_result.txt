the fa cup has been through a rollercoaster of emotions over the years - and now it is taking an actual rollercoaster ride . the famous trophy was on show at alton towers theme park in staffordshire ahead of this weekend 's semi-finals at wembley , nestled in between an arsenal fan and reading supporter . but they almost suffered a huge upset at wembley last year against hull before coming from behind to win one of the most entertaining finals of all time . and liverpool or aston villa will be out to get their hands on the cup on may 30 too .
