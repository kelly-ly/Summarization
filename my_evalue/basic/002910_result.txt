when you consider 80 per cent of our information about the outside world comes through our eyes , it 's hardly surprising studies show eye contact to be the most effective way to signal sexual interest . a normal face scan lasts three seconds , scan for four-and-a-half and it 's clear someone has ' caught your eye ' . let your eyes settle on someone so they 're aware you 've noticed them , then as they 're still watching you , slide your eyes around the room before settling back on them again .
