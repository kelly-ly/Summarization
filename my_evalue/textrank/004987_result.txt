after the launch of the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus , several new owners complained that the slim aluminium phones bent out of shape after being placed in tight pockets . apple polishes the aluminium used in its sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch-proof outer layer . addressing ‘ bend gate’ after the phone’s launch , apple spokeswoman trudy muller said : ' with normal use , a bend in iphone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale , a total of nine customers have contacted apple with a bent iphone 6 plus . ' tests showed that the phone bent out of shape under 100lbs of pressure - the same as the samsung galaxy s6 edge . the reason for the bend is due to the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus being made out of aluminium .
