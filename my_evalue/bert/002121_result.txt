an eagle demonstrated its footwork after gate-crashing a football teamâ€™s training session and enjoying a solo kick-about . the bird interrupts the training session by approaching a football and giving it a peck before enjoying a kick-about . upping the quality , the eagle rolls the ball to the left once more but this time keeps its foot on top of it so that it is controlled underneath . the ball is then passed back to the bird by the video maker , but the eagle seems to have lost interest and lets the ball roll by .
