goals from james mccarthy , john stones and substitute kevin mirallas did not flatter everton and van gaal claimed the difference between the two sides came in the attitude and approach they adopted , as united could not match everton’s commitment . van gaal admitted he was worried after watching united go through their pre-match warm-up at goodison park and those fears were shared by his assistants , ryan giggs and albert stuivenberg , both of whom expressed their concerns to van gaal about the squad’s sharpness . ‘ when you have a lot of time on the ball , you can lose the ball also easily and then you have to be very sharp in the duels that counts , ’ said van gaal .
