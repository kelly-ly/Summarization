they found that the intense but short-lived heat near the impact site could not have ignited live plants , challenging the idea that the impact led to global firestorms . while this was too short to ignite live plant material nearby , the effects of the impact further away could have been sufficient to set some material alight . this has allowed a step forward in the debate surrounding the end cretaceous impact and will help geoscientists interpret the fossil record and evaluate potential future impacts . ' in addition , the methods we developed in the laboratory for this research have driven new developments in our current understanding of how materials behave in fires particularly at the wildland-urban-interface , meaning that we have been able to answer questions relating to both ancient mass extinctions at the same time as developing understanding of the impact of wildfires in urban areas today .
