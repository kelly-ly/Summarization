a new orleans couple bought a ramshackle historic cottage , moved it across the city and renovated it all the while using salvaged materials and respecting the home 's original floor plan . to honor the home 's original duplex floor plan while still creating a single-family home , ensslen and tillero put a massive wooden staircase between the kitchen and living room . for the kitchen cabinets and drawers , ensslen used forks and spooks given to him by his parents when he moved to new orleans . ensslen and tillero 's bedroom door was recycled from the old maison blanche department store chain in new orleans .
