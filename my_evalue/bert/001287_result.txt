two ' unemployed rich kids ' have caused outrage in china after causing a major traffic accident in central beijing by racing and wrecking an underpass and two luxurious supercars . although both of the drivers claimed the accident was caused by the slippery road conditions at the entrance of the tunnel , the state of the crash scene led chinese internet users to speculate that the pair had been ' drag racing ' , which is illegal in china . another 'bluesky1963 ' from hunan said simply ' the spoilt rich . ' the people 's daily reports that the wreckage of the lamborghini was around 100 metres from the ferrari and that there were no brake marks visible on the road .
