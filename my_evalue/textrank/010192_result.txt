alan pardew says sunderland should be more concerned about his in-form crystal palace side than his past as newcastle manager this saturday . crystal palace boss alan pardew thinks sunderland fans should concentrate on his in-form side . ' irrespective of my reception , it 's about the 11 players on the pitch and sunderland fans know that we 're in really good form . ' he 's been exceptional since i 've been here , so we 'll give him every opportunity to play . ' pardew , after four years as newcastle boss , knows sunderland well and was not surprised the black cats turned to former rangers and holland boss dick advocaat . '
