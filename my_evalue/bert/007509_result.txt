for more than 2,000 years , invaders have been fighting over glorious kefalonia . the portions are generous and there 's a great view across the bay to fellow ionian isle zakynthos . we loved our stay in the south , but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35-mile drive to fiscardo , on the island 's north cape . the trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of myrtos beach - as well as many little inland villages .
