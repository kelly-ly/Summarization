blatter ( left ) has received the backing of african football 's president issa hayatou ( right ) . ' even when he ( hayatou ) announced he would support blatter , we could notice a difference from past congresses when a statement like that normally is followed by a standing ovation . ' this time we heard just a normal applause , which confirms my idea that a lot of african countries understand and agree with the need to change for the better of everyone , especially the national associations . ' in fact there were federation presidents who ensured me they would vote for me but they were reluctant to saying this out loud because they feared reactions against them , their federations and even their countries , ' said figo . ' the caf congress in cairo ended on tuesday with hayatou declaring africa 's complete support for blatter 's re-election but on all previous occasions when the caf chief has promised a block of african votes , many have broken ranks .
