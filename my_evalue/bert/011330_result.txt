one can only imagine the gloomy mood that must have collectively descended on the european tour 's headquarters at wentworth last week when reading about the acts of selflessness of the new masters champion , jordan spieth . then , despite the obvious fatigue , he flew to south carolina to keep his promise to play the heritage tournament — his fourth event in a row — because , well , they were good to him on the way up and he wanted to pay them back . but , equally , as spieth at the age of just 21 is effortlessly showing , sometimes it 's simply about doing the right thing . twenty-five years after his runaway victory at st andrews , sir nick faldo will play in his last open at the home of golf this july .
