( cnn ) i 've been a chef in some form or another since i was 14 years old , but i did n't become a food activist until much later . to be sure , america 's food system is complex , and some may argue that industrial farming has been a necessity to meet our country 's food needs . however , the quality of our food has been sacrificed at this supposed altar of necessity , as industrial farms reap enormous profits that they direct toward lobbying rather than improving the quality of food they produce . and since the actual costs of industrially raised meat are hidden , humanely raised meat appears expensive by comparison .
