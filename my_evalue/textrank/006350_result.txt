mr cameron is due to go head-to-head in a seven-way debate tomorrow night with the leaders of labour , lib dems , ukip , greens , snp and plaid cymru . mr cameron argued that committed volunteers have ‘ knocked on doors , stuffed envelopes , licked stamps to get his fat arse on the commons benches , and this is how he repays them’ . mr cameron has admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold .
