volunteers who have restored one of the dunkirk ' little ships ' are now hoping they will be able to take the unique vessel back to the beaches where it helped to rescue 600 british soldiers . fire boat massey shaw was requisitioned from the london fire brigade in 1940 and transported to dunkirk to help with the evacuation of allied troops in the face of the nazi advance . massey shaw is still capable of pumping out 3,000 gallons of water every minute - as much as four fire engines - despite being 80 years old .
