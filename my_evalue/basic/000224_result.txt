( cnn ) australia has recalled its ambassador to indonesia for consultations after two australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early wednesday . australian prime minister tony abbott called the executions `` cruel and unnecessary '' because both men , andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , had been `` fully rehabilitated '' during a decade in prison . the indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed , but at the last moment filipina mary jane veloso was spared .
