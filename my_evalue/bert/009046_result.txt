everyone is watching valencia’s 19-year-old left back jose luis gaya with manchester city , arsenal and chelsea hoping to snatch him from under real madrid’s nose this summer . when you consider that luke shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested ; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the premier league . he has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time juan bernat has moved up an age category , stepping into his place . at madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the east coast .
