a family pooch received an interesting make-over when it came back from the groomers looking less like a domesticated pet and more like a wild cat . similar to a lion , the dog’s tail remains unshaved apart from the very top of it , while the pooch’s overall colouring also helps create the illusion . unsure as to why its owner is reacting in such a way , the dog continues to wander around the house . the dog boasts a voluminous mane around its head and neck and looks somewhat majestic .
