paul scholes believes the turning point of manchester united’s season came when angel di maria was sent off against arsenal in fa cup as it allowed louis van gaal to turn to his fringe players . the £60million signing missed manchester united’s impressive 3-0 win over tottenham in which marouane fellaini was one of the stand out players and a result that sparked united’s impressive run of form which has seen them go on and beat liverpool and manchester city in recent weeks . ’ despite united’s impressive run of form which has seen them pick up 25 points from their last 10 games – scholes says they are still some way off challenging for the title and putting a good run a form together towards the end of the season is not what makes a great team .
