i’ve been out injured for a whole year now , but i’m finally on the verge of a return to regular training . this happened a lot during my training up in manchester , so in october we all sat down and decided the best thing was to send me to bisham abbey rehabilitation centre . as well as funding the road to rio athletes , every week national lottery players raise over £33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities .
