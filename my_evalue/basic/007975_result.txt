giant glaciers of ice may be lurking all over mars , hidden from view by dust on the surface . this image from nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter shows that a thick layer of dust on mars covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . in total there is more than 150 billion cubic metres of ice on mars , which could ‘ cover the entire surface of mars with 1.1 metres of ice , ’ explained dr nanna bjørnholt karlsson at the centre for ice and climate at the niels bohr institute .
