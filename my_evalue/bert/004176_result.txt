sam allardyce believes queens park rangers goalkeeper rob green is good enough to challenge england no 1 joe hart for a place in the national team . and allardyce , whose side face green and co at loftus road on saturday , still holds his former stopper in high esteem and thinks the 35-year-old could once again stake a claim to be england’s main man between the posts . green has won 12 england caps but made a calamitous error in the world cup against usa in 2010 . financially we could n't get there – that was the key element , ’ allardyce said of west ham’s attempts to keep green at the club .
