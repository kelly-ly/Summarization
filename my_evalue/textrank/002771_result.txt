jonathan brownlee backed up his win in auckland a fortnight ago by taking the gold coast triathlon in the itu world series on saturday . i saw the four of us and thought lets be aggressive . ' on the run i knew they would take time out of me on the first lap , then i thought ' be steady , and if i run 30:30 it 's going to take a great run for them to catch me ' , and fortunately they did n't . ' world champion javier gomez took third . in the women 's race , gwen jorgensen racked up an eighth series victory in a row , leading a clean sweep of americans on the podium with sarah true second and katie zaferes third .
