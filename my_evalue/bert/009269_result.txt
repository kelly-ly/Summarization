living in the depths of an ancient woodland might sound like a fairytale . an idyllic two-bedroom log cabin , nestled down a private country lane in the heart of the new forest , has gone on the market for Â£350,000 . the property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished . ten centuries on , the forest is still largely in royal hands , with around 90 per cent of it belonging to the crown .
