two birds of prey have been caught on camera brutally fighting over a nesting box , staring each other down before attacking each other with sharp talons and beaks . and despite the owl 's cuddly reputation , it came out the victor , forcing the kestrel to seek an alternative home for itself and its mate . on top : at one point the kestrel had the owl up against the wall of the box inside an old tree stump . but the barn owl is my favourite bird and i wanted them to nest here too .
