from a rusting ferris wheel to a train rendered barely visible due to overgrown weeds , this japanese theme park has n't heard the happy screams of visiting children in a very long time . looking at his images , it 's hard to believe that the park , which opened in 1979 , once attracted 200,000 visitors annually from around the country . today , the broken down remains of the park are tourist attractions in their own right , with many of urban photographers keen to take snaps . according to the japan times , the theme park was built next to the site of the ' pond of the ghost woman ' , an ancient myth which is claimed could have been factor in its untimely closure .
