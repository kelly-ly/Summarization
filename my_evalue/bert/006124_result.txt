crawling commando-style underneath an open-sided land rover , i came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino . danny , our brilliant tracker , who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary , had eventually located them , but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the land rover . the african bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark . heading back to the luxury accommodation at cliff lodge , a two-bedroom apartment within rock lodge ( mum described it as glamping but with solid walls , luxury furnishings , soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food ) , we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see , if possible .
