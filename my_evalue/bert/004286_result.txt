mark selby was straight into an auspicious groove as he began his title defence at the betfred world championship on saturday . the 31-year-old from leicester rocked ronnie o'sullivan in last year 's final to claim his maiden crucible title , and returned to ease 6-3 ahead of kurt maflin in their first-round tussle . selby salutes the crucible crowd on his arrival . back came maflin with an 88 break , but when selby bustled through the last of the session he had a commanding advantage to take into the concluding session , needing just four more frames to reach the second round .
