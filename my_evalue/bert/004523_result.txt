jesus christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist . this claim comes from biblical scholar dr adam bradford , who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so-called ' missing years ' of jesus ' life , when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in judea . instead mark portrays him as being persuaded by the jewish leaders to execute him . ' mr fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account .
