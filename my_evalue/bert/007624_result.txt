from david cameron and nick clegg sitting on the gogglebox sofa to ed miliband doing a kate winslet in titanic , these are some of the best memes posted in reference to the leaders’ debate . fight me , b**** ' : the labour leader posed a direct message to the prime minister , saying : ' david , if you think this election is about leadership , then debate me one-on-one ' odd one out : the five party leaders who took part in the debate were put in the places of the mighty morphin power rangers in another image - although mr farage was hidden behind the black ranger , zack taylor . the images were inspired by a debate that saw mr miliband warned he would not get into power without lurching left , as miss sturgeon told him he is ‘ not strong enough’ to win power on his own . preparing for battle : mr miliband pictured as rocky in the famous meat-punching scene from the 1976 film .
