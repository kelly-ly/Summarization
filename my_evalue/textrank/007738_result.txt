both nic ( left ) and christopher ( centre , with eldest brother ben right ) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . i did n't want to leave because i met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world â€¦ and the reason i really got along with these guys was because it was the first time i had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue . ' the level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother christopher .
