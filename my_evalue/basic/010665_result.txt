a green-tinged cloaked figure in a medieval manuscript ( pictured ) bears more than a little resemblance to yoda from the star wars films , but is in fact a part of a strange representation of the biblical story of samson . ‘ the yoda image comes from a 14th century manuscript known as the smithfield decretals , ’ british library curator julian harrison told mailonline . ‘ i 'd love to say that it really was yoda , or was drawn by a medieval time traveller , but it 's actually an illustration to the biblical story of samson — the artist clearly had a vivid imagination !
