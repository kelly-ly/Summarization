once a charismatic and well-known presence on the televangelist circuit , schuller faded from view in recent years after watching his church collapse amid a disastrous leadership transition and sharp declines in viewership and donations that ultimately forced the ministry to file for bankruptcy . the soaring , glass-paned crystal cathedral — the touchstone of schuller 's storied ministry — was sold to the roman catholic diocese of orange in 2011 , and schuller lost a legal battle the following year to collect more than $ 5 million from his former ministry for claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract . he and his late wife , arvella ( seen together in 1950 ) started a ministry in 1955 with $ 500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of los angeles .
