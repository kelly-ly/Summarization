the tragic death of a seven-week-old baby in his mother’s bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns . at the baby’s inquest this week , a coroner in pembrokeshire said new parents were given ‘confusing’ advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child . the welsh government’s ‘ reducing the risk of cot death’ leaflet , which offers similar advice to the nhs in england , says parents should not share a bed with a young baby if they ‘ feel very tired’ , take drugs , smoke , or have drunk alcohol .
