the fact jimmy anderson and sir ian botham are the leading wicket-takers in england test history proves cricket is a game in which players of completely different character can thrive . botham gives two thumbs up as he watches the action unfold during the test match in antigua . cook had to remind the leader of his attack that england had more than 400 to play with and needed to attack so the captain got his way , even though anderson looked grumpy about it . jimmy anderson was one of the nicest blokes i captained and i was delighted when he broke sir ianâ€™s record here .
