google claims to have cracked a problem that has flummoxed anyone who has tried to read a doctor 's note - how to read anyone 's handwriting . the firm claims the latest update to its android handsets can under 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts , and works with both printed and cursive writing input with or without a stylus . google also today launched a new feature allowing users who have lost their phone to simply google it . both tools override the selected sound profile , too , meaning that even if a phone is on silent it will still ring at full volume for five minutes .
