you have so many strong teams here in england and in champions league , you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year ; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money . and if liverpool do allow sterling to leave , city want to be involved in the chase for one of england’s most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players . ‘ for this club trying to be a big team in so few years , maybe we are paying the cost for that . ’ since the transfer penalties were introduced , city have spent £91million on players in the last two windows ( net spend £68million ) .
