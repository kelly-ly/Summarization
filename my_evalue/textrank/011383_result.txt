alex salmond has provoked outrage after he was caught boasting : ' i 'm writing labour 's budget . ' secret footage showed the former first minister , who is bidding to become an mp , mocking labour after it slapped down its scottish leader jim murphy , who claimed he would write the party 's budget north of the border . ' the point made in a light-hearted way was that scottish labour leader jim murphy had been slapped down by his party bosses at westminster and told that he would have no role in a labour budget , ' mr salmond said . ' david cameron is clearly a prime minister with both a people bypass and a sense of humour bypass . '
