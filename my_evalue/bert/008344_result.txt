the son of a syrian imam who was shot dead on a london street may have met his father’s killer just days before the murder . arwani 's children are in little doubt their father was killed by the man asking for the building quote . one syrian opposition activist has said despite arwami’s standing and his participation in protests against the assad regime in london in 2012 ( pictured ) the imam was an unlikely target for assassination . bassam tablieh , a solicitor and opponent of the syrian government , said there were many more obvious , high priority targets for syrian authorities to go after in london .
