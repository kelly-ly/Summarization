congratulations to australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas . the game is changing and australia have realised that . matt giteau and drew mitchell , for example , are top-class performers for toulon and if england lose to australia with those two playing out of their skins , you know exactly what the headlines will be . when it comes to the big games , the other england players will want to have the best possible squad available .
