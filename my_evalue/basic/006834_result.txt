caroline wozniacki never doubted she would grace the courts of tennis ' grand slam tournaments even when she was a giggling schoolgirl just coming through the ranks . even as a 10/11 year old i was looking forward to roland garros # confidence # believe # impossibleisnothing ' . wozniacki made her french open debut as a 17-year-old and will be hoping to go further than the quarter-final best she managed in 2010 when the tournament begins on may 25 - she has still never won a grand slam title , although she has reached the us open final twice .
