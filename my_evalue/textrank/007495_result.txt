local authorities have tried to capitalise on this popularity by building a winding series of mountain roads and glass walkways along some of the sheerest cliff faces . it is not known exactly where this walkway is being constructed , but it is very similar in appearance to another mountain path being built along the side of shifou mountain , in nearby jiangxi province . hard labour : the men are expected to spend their days hauling heavy wooden planks and wheelbarrows full of concrete back and forth across the walkway , despite being suspended thousands of feet in the air with no safety equipment .
