the 2012 tour de france winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad , ' wiggins ' , before a return to the track ahead of the rio olympics , and wanted to sign off from what he called a ' golden era ' with a win in one of the sport 's most prestigious races . but it was not to be as germany 's john degenkolb produced the perfect race to cross the line first at the end of a gruelling 151-mile trek which took in 27 tortuous cobbled spells . wiggins did his best , breaking away with 32 kilometres left to shake things up at the head of the peloton , while he also made a late push , but in the end he had to settle for a place down the line in 18th as degenkolb took the glory .
