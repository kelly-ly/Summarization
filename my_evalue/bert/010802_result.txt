women travelling on the london underground are being urged to report sexual assaults in a new initiative . the uncomfortable footage - which uses actors - sees the woman hounded by an increasingly persistent male , who looks her up and down , gets on to the same train carriage and then gropes her . according to tlc , one in ten londoners have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on public transport , but 90 per cent of these incidents go unreported . our officers are trained to deal with these sort of cases .
