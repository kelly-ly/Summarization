councils are pocketing thousands in change by forcing drivers to overpay for parking because their meters do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago . town halls have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the uk - making it impossible for drivers to pay the exact cost of parking . in manchester , where 240 machines are still not upgraded , motorists without old-style coins must use £1 and two 20p pieces for a typical £1.25 hour 's parking - handing the council a 15p profit . experts fear the problem could become even worse when the new 12-sided pound coin is released in 2017 .
