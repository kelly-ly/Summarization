the father of american sniper chris kyle has spoken for the first time since his son 's killer was sentenced to life in prison , in an emotionally-charged interview with nbc news . he added that he did n't like routh 's trial being called the ' american sniper trial ' in the media since it distracted from chad littlefield 's equally tragic death . wayne kyle described the movie , american sniper , as an absolute disgrace for the way in which it portrayed his other son , iraq veteran jeff kyle ( pictured ) , as ' cowardly ' . to me , those people have no self-worth ... their only claim to fame is to try to destroy somebody who has the values like what chris possessed .
