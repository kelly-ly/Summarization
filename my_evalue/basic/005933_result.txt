mercedes motorsport boss toto wolff has revealed the team may have to make ' an unpopular call ' for their drivers in light of ferrari 's revival this season . wolff 's remark also comes in the wake of nico rosberg 's moaning over the team radio during sunday 's chinese grand prix about how slow team-mate lewis hamilton was driving . but wolff has confirmed that with pressure from ferrari , rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season , there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other .
