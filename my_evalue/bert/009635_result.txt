a financial fund for killer cop michael slager was shut down by crowd-funding website , gofundme , on wednesday . a separate fundraising campaign was started on site , indiegogo , titled the ' michael t. slager support fund ' and featured a picture of slager in his police uniform . a well-wisher of the accused killer cop gave a private donation to the fundraising page on indiegogo and listed their name as ' trayvon ' - perhaps in a twisted reference to trayvon martin , an unarmed black teenager who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in florida in 2012 . marquese lewis posted on the facebook page supporting slager : ' how about the real reason is you are an ignorant racist supporting a murderer .
