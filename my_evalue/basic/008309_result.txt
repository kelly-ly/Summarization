my eyes narrow , those flowing locks are the enemy â€” a breeding ground for the bane of my life : pediculus humanus capitis , or head lice ( a nit is the egg sac laid by the female louse on the hair shaft of their human hosts ) . dais ( pictured as a child ) says she was never affected by head lice when she was younger , only getting them for the first time when she was 19 . their heads and mine were five-star hotels for head lice and no sooner had i eliminated one nit invasion , another would follow .
