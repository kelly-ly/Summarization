the modern-day martin burgess clock b is based on john harrison 's 18th century clock , which he thought up to solve the problem of determining longitude at sea . the martin burgess b clock has been part of a 100-day trial at the royal observatory ( above ) , in greenwich , to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true . local time is one hour ahead for every 15 degrees of longitude east and one hour behind for every 15 degrees of longitude west .
