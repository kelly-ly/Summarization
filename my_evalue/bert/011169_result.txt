the family rift in france’s national front deepened yesterday after founder jean-marie le pen pulled out of regional elections – but said his granddaughter should stand in his place . now party founder le pen has told french publication le figaro that he will not stand in the south-east provence-alpes-cote d’azur region ‘ even though i think i am the best candidate’ . mr le pen said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter marion marechal-le pen , 25 , who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party’s nomination . unlike marine , marion was firmly against a 2013 law permitting same-sex marriage in france .
