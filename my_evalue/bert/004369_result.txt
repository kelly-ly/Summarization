marathon season is in full swing with the london marathon set to take place a week on sunday . at Â£130 , the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole does n't seem to be that durable . the aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap . aldi : the shoes are not available in half sizes so i opted for my usual shoe size , despite this they still felt too big .
