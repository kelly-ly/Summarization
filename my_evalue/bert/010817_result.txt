denmark has finally passed a law banning bestiality in an attempt to crack down on perverts visiting the country to have sex with animals . it 's hard to prove that an animal suffers when a human has sexual intercourse with it , and that is why we must give the animal the benefit of the doubt . ' more recently , a 2011 justice ministry report surveyed veterinarians and found 17 percent of them suspected that an animal they treated had had intercourse with a human . the advent of the internet no doubt helped the boom in animal sex tourism : there are entire forums dedicated to helping people swap advice on bestiality , as well as pornography .
