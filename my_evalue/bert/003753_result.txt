tastes change , of course , but looking at some of the adverts that graced newspapers and magazines in the latter half of the 20th century , it 's hard to believe that the advertising brains behind them thought they might actually work . a tan , blond moustache and a pair of curtains ... although this ad fails to notice that the man in the photo is n't actually ' dark ' , the ad brains behind it are clearly convinced it will sell more dubonnet , a wine-based aperitif . the machismo never ends : moustachioed men are seen advertising brands of scotch and whisky . very , very successful sweater wearing ... if you did n't know how to achieve that , this earlier advert from lux in 1962 would show you how .
