the days of filling your car with petrol may be numbered because researchers have boosted the efficiency of making hydrogen fuel from plant waste . us scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't pollute the environment like fossil fuels . the breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor . now , researchers at virginia polytechnic institute and state university have shown that it’s possible to convert 100 per cent of the sugar in corn stalks and husks – a by-product of farming – into hydrogen gas , which can be used to power vehicles .
