millionaire real estate heir robert durst was indicted wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in new orleans even though his lawyers say he wants to go to los angeles as soon as possible to face a murder charge there . a hearing in the new orleans case had been scheduled for thursday before a magistrate . the real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest . his lawyers claim his asperger 's syndrome led him to erroneously trust the hbo producers , who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial .
