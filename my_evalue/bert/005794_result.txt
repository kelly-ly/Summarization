iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on thursday demanded that all sanctions on iran be lifted at the same time as any final agreement with world powers on curbing tehran 's nuclear program is reached . ali alfoneh , a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies , told daily mail online that up-front lifting of sanctions is a bad idea that might be put into practice anyway . ' i was never optimistic about negotiating with america ... nonetheless i agreed to the negotiations and supported , and still support , the negotiators , ' khamenei said , ' i support a deal that preserves the interests and honor of iran . ' khamenei is now saying no foreign inspectors , including those from the iaea , will be allowed to tour the military facilities where iran 's nuclear operations are housed .
