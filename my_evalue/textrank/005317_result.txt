yet the following morning , when mccoy awakes an ex-jockey , he will understand there are no more competitive rides , no more races , no more cheltenhams or aintrees or even modest little handicap hurdles to separate him from the field . ap mccoy will race at sandown on saturday for the last time before he retires after a successful career . to date , mccoy has 4,357 winning memories . in 2001-02 , he rode over 1,000 times in britain alone and since richard dunwoody claimed 160 winners to be crowned champion jump jockey in 1994-95 , mccoy has surpassed that total in each of his 20 seasons .
