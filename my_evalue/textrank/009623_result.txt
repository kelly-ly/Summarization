tottenham defender ben davies will allow no room for sentiment up against wales team-mate sam vokes at burnley on sunday . davies chases a loose ball for tottenham along with chelsea 's willian earlier this season in a barclays premier league clash at stamford bridge which the blues won 3-0 . spurs had some 13 players away on senior international duty , with striker harry kane again impressing for the three lions , scoring on his debut against lithuania at wembley , while andros townsend netted an equaliser against italy in turn on tuesday night , when midfielder ryan mason made his bow .
