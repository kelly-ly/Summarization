women have long been warned that the older they are , the greater the risk of health problems for them and their baby - but research now suggests older fathers can also affect baby 's health . advanced paternal age ( over 40 ) increases the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by around 60 per cent , according to one of the studies the american researchers looked at ( one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer ) . a study from iceland in 2012 found that the average child born to a 20-year-old father has 25 dna mutations in their genes and that the number increases annually , reaching 65 mutations for offspring of 40-year-old men , increasing the risk of problems . advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defects , say the baylor researchers , whose study is being published in the journal fertility and sterility .
