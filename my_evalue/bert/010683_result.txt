i see usain bolt on the circuit and he’s always good fun . hopefully i can get a bit more serious , now that i’ve just finished uni and i will start to get a bit more competitive with those guys . after those guys have retired — sprinters like tyson gay and justin gatlin — it’ s quite open for people to step in and take the mantle . there will be a nice little gap opening and it will encourage a lot of people to step up their performance .
