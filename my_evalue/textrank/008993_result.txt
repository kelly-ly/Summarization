mccain , responding to the supreme leader of iran's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is ' instant , ' said he had ' sympathy ' for iranian ayatollah ali khamenei , because kerry ' must have known ' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord ' and yet chose to interpret it in another way . ' launching a rare attack from his official white house twitter account , president barack obama 's spokesman josh earnest in turn said it was 'naïve and reckless ' for mccain ' to believe every word of the supreme leader 's political speech . ' republican senator mark kirk on thursday said , 'it’s increasingly clear that iran , in fact , failed to reach agreement with the united states and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement . ' at best , iran agreed to disagree with the united states on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks , ' the illinois lawmaker said . ' graham said the obama administration should tell iran ' in no uncertain terms – that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties , sanctions relief will not be immediate . ' ' any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program . ' drawing on khamenei 's comment about supervision , graham said he would ' never ' lend his support to a deal that does n't allow for inspections ' anytime and anywhere . '
