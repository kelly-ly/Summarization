five hundred years later , just one of the inca rope bridges remains : the keshwa chaca , which spans the apurimac river near huinchiri , peru , in the province of canas . incredible skill : the 90ft long keshwa chaca remains thanks to local villagers who rebuild the bridge each year using the same techniques as their inca ancestors . in the inca days , local villagers would rebuild the keshwa chaca each year as a way of paying tax , but in modern times residents of the region keep the ancient tradition and skills alive by renewing the bridge every june .
