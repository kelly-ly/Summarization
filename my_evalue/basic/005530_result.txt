a swedish firm is hoping to make getting around with a young child easier - and save your aching arms - by introducing the bike seat that doubles up as a stroller . called p√•hoj , it clips onto the back of a standard bike using a specially-designed attachment . a child , up to a height of 3.2ft ( 1 metres ) , is then strapped into the seat in an almost vertical position .
