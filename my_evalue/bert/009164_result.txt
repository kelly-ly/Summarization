ed miliband’s son has inadvertently waded into the row about the labour leader’s kitchen as he declared it ‘ the best’ in his house . and it led to accusations that mr miliband lives an ‘ upstairs , downstairs’ lifestyle last night as he was forced to admit that he needs two kitchens because the family nanny lives in the basement of his london ‘mansion’ . but the revelation that he keeps the help downstairs will do little to bolster mr miliband’s claim that he is in touch with struggling families . mr miliband’s decision to again make prominent use of his sons daniel and samuel , four , to bolster his image is also likely to raise eyebrows .
