a gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers Â£200,000 . parish councillor maxine chew said : ' it is a disgrace that a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this . ' the travellers really have been the neighbours from hell . the camp ( pictured ) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the court of appeal last year .
