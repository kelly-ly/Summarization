it is the current prime minister 's kitchen that has got everyone talking more than any of the other political leaders ' – perhaps because he is a known ' toff ' , and britain , despite protests from the left and now the right , really still are obsessed with class . those pesky middle-middle classes have fallen hook , line and capsule for these sleekly designed , all style and no substance coffee machines , but those of true upmarket stock know that you ca n't beat freshly ground coffee in a cafetiere . very few people will see these – but that does n't matter as you 're upper-middle class or above and so do n't care whether people see it or not – but a good , solid bin bag is heavenly and you ca n't imagine going back to the cheap ones now .
