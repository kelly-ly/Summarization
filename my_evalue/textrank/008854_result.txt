jacobean dramatist john fletcher ( left ) most likely collaborated with shakespeare on double falsehood ( right ) , which was long thought not to have had anything to do with the bard . boyd said : ' honestly , i was surprised to see such a strong signal for shakespeare showing through in the results . ' going into the research without any real background knowledge , i had just kind of assumed it was going to be a pretty cut and dry case of a fake shakespeare play , which would have been really interesting in and of itself . ' tangled relationships , women disguised as men , intrigue laced with tragedy and comedy - some might say double falsehood has all the hallmarks of shakespeare . he claimed the versification was very similar to other works by shakespeare and that double falsehood contained words never seen before and not previously used by theobald .
