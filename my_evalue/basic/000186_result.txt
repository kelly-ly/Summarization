( cnn ) president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president . there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . as the years of his presidency unfolded , and the middle east started coming apart , finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind .
