your wedding is fast approaching and , as a last hurrah , you decide to celebrate in the most extravagant way possible - with a trip to ‘ space vegas ' . the images were created by concept artist alex brady , 32 , from cambridge in the uk , who normally works on video games and movies . these planes are commonly known as single-stage-to-orbit ( ssto ) vehicles , as they could take off from a runway and land back on earth without having to use an expendable rocket - like the space shuttle had to . he adds that these images aren’t meant to be taken as a wholly serious look at the future of space travel , but rather ‘ a light-hearted imagining of the future where even a poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero-g roulette tables ! ’
