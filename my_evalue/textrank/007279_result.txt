ted cruz is personally against the legalization of marijuana but the republican presidential candidate said this weekend that he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law . cruz implied during a conversation with daily mail online on saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he would n't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the drug . the response indicated that cruz , if president , would not force his attorney general 's office to go after states that legalize pot because he does n't think the supremacy clause of the constitution should be applied in areas where voters have said they want to get high without repercussions . ' the framers of our constitution understood cooperative federalism -- the overlapping spheres of authority between the federal and state governments -- and federal law enforcement can and often should respect and incorporate state law , ' the statement from cruz 's campaign continued . ' the voters of the states of colorado and washington have made the decision to legalize marijuana , and that is a change in law that alters the appropriate enforcement of federal law . '
