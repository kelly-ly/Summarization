turkey told the vatican ambassador it was ' deeply sorry and disappointed ' in pope francis , adding that his comments had caused a ' problem of trust ' . turkey said pope francis has caused a ' problem of trust ' after describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5million armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 as ' the first genocide of the 20th century ' . while turkey accepts that many armenians died in clashes with ottoman soldiers beginning in 1915 , when armenia was part of the empire ruled from istanbul , it denies that the victims reached the estimated 1.5million and that this amounted to genocide .
