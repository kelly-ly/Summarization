so who will be voted pfa player of the year ? i mentioned terry will have been influential in the chelsea dressing room when it came to voting . but on a serious note about him , i am very surprised that he is not on the shortlist . english clubs simply donâ€™t have defenders who are willing to do that , perhaps with the exception of john terry , and the statistics from our representatives in the champions league this season prove that point emphatically .
