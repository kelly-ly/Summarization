there wonâ€™t be many who can guess which barclays premier league player picked up my first 10-out-of-10 performance of the season this weekend . the criticism was so bad the player started to doubt himself and admits he almost gave up football . and it was his strength that won the ball off gareth macauley on the halfway line - then you can only admire his storming surge towards goal and the quality finish as he rifles the ball into the back of the net for the winner in injury time , embarrassing lescott again . good on you lad .
