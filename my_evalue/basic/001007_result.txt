washington ( cnn ) israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart iran 's nuclear ambitions , saying he sees better options than `` this bad deal or war . '' `` i think there 's a third alternative , and that is standing firm , ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal , '' netanyahu told cnn 's jim acosta sunday on `` state of the union . '' his comments come as democrats and republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections .
