not every greek island lets you rent a boat and potter about at will , but skopelos does . we opted for a villa . up a steep hill from skopelos town , and along a dirt track ( vehicle needed ) lies villa thea , with its cool stone floors , pool and large terrace . thalpos holidays boat hire operates out of sheltered panormos beach on the west coast , a 20-minute drive from skopelos town .
