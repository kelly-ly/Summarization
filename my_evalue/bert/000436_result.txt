( cnn ) the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed . that would lead to an absurd result . maybe . the reason you do n't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements ; for a company , a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence , whether or not it 's found guilty .
