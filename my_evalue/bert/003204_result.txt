the ' campaign ' continues against chelsea when it comes to penalties â€“ although in a first half with four penalty appeals it was clear that referee , michael oliver was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those . the blues had a good shout for an early penalty when oscar was clipped by bellerin but i agreed with oliver that the contact was accidental and minimal - a penalty would have been very harsh . oliver may well have been waiting to see if oscar 's lob went in the goal but once it was cleared he should have gone back , awards the penalty and cautioned ospina . cesc fabregas was booked after appearing to kick his leg out to find contact from santi cazorla .
