everton defender john stones was the shock name on barcelona’s shopping list of central defenders last summer . barcelona ended up signing 31-year-old jeremy mathieu from valencia for £14.5m and 29-year-old thomas vermaelen from arsenal for £15m but influential voices at the catalan club urged then sporting director andoni zubizarreta to bid for 20-year-old stones instead . in the end barcelona coach luis enrique insisted on the signing of mathieu – another who can also fill-in at full-back - and stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five-year deal keeping him at everton until 2019 .
