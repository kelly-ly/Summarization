i yield to no one in my love of the old days — warm beer , cricket on the village green , bobbies on bicycles two by two , all that — but it 's rare a chance arises to compare the rose-tinted past with the brave new world , as it did on saturday evening when sky 's high-octane premier league coverage went head-to-head with arsenal v reading in the fa cup semi-final on the bbc . lest you were in any doubt , its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late sir laurence olivier doing the st crispin 's day speech from the film of henry v ( ' we happy few , we band of brothers , ' and so on ) . bbc presenter lineker prepares to present the match of the day 50th anniversary special broadcast . in such instances , the bbc is lucky to retain the services of gary lineker , the best presenter of live football on tv .
