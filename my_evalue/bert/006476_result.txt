a 30-year-old scouser released by shrewsbury and tranmere in recent years was the hero of scottish football at the weekend . well with scotland 's top club , celtic , taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the sfa crying about a penalty they were n't awarded against inverness , you can see there are problems . large swathes of hampden were empty for both scottish cup semi-finals over the weekend . but the standard is not high , and that 's not healthy for scottish football .
