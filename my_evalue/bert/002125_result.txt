two base jumpers who broke their backs and were told they may never walk again after they fell 500ft have started jumping again . he said : ' i remember standing on austin 's shoulders and getting ready while our friends held him there . ' i then landed in his parachute , looked up and saw the sky above me and his canopy flapping around . as mr carey jumped off the ledge of the bridge , mr rawe ( left , top ) got his foot stuck on the railings , the pair then began to tumble towards the river bank 500ft below ( right ) without their parachutes opening properly .
