as well as keeping alive hopes of an unlikely charge to the premier league title , victory for arsenal at turf moor on saturday will also ensure arsene wenger 's men claim the longest winning streak in the top-flight this season . now just seven points behind leaders chelsea , arsenal have a chance to surpass manchester city 's equally impressive run of seven victories in a row this season when they take on relegation-threatened burnley in saturday 's late kick-off . that run , which was also overseen by wenger , helped arsenal beat liverpool and manchester united to the 2001-02 title before a draw at west ham in the second game of the following season ended the streak .
