it may have been miley cyrus ' pink heart-shaped nipple pasties that garnered all the attention when she paid honour to rocker joan jett on saturday , but eagle-eyed fans were distracted by something else . savvy social media users noticed that the 22-year-old , who attended the 30th annual rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony on saturday in cleveland , ohio , had given her razor a night off . a lot of users did n't understand why people were ' freaking out ' over the singer 's armpit hair , with charlie saying : ' miley cyrus ' armpit hair is n't `` hideous '' , we all see men 's armpit hair but that 's apparently acceptable because they 're men . please shut up ' .
