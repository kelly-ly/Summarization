( cnn ) the listeria outbreak that prompted blue bell creameries to recall their entire product line dates to 2010 , according to the centers for disease control . listeria did n't get into ice cream through the milk because blue bell uses pasteurized milk , caroline smith dewaal , director of food safety for center for science in the public interest , told cnn on tuesday . dewaal said the listeria probably was n't linked to blue bell in 2010 because one case would n't spark a full investigation . `` we 're committed to doing the 100 percent right thing , and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe , '' kruse said in a statement on the company 's website .
