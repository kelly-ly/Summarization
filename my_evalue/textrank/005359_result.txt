ms hiley was involved in the launch of baby gaga breast milk ice cream in 2011 and teamed up again with ice cream maker matt o'connor to create the product . my face does fall slightly when i 'm told that yes i am in luck , there is a large pot of vanilla ice cream on the desk however , it has been created using human lactation . ' it is extremely sweet , reminiscent of those blocks of vanilla ice cream that were served in school canteens .
