cadbury has snatched two chocolate fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22 . burton’s said it did reduce the wholesale price of the packs to supermarkets to reflect the lower weight , but it had no say over whether this was passed this on to customers . the firm was taken over by kraft of the us in 2010 in a deal worth £11.5billion , which has come under fire for a series of cost cutting measures that have undermined the historic british brand . they have also come under fire for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in poland .
