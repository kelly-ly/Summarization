labour leader ed miliband read from motivational notes during the leaders’ televised debate ( above ) . his scrawled notes , found in his dressing room after the itv debate , give an insight into his mindset before he took to the rostrum with the six other party leaders . jfk captured hearts and minds by appearing to talk directly to voters . as for his closing statement , ‘let’s bring the change britain needs’ , it seems a rip-off of the slogan used by barack obama who , in 2008 , talked endlessly about ‘ change we can believe in’ .
