mr clegg repeatedly clashed with mr gove over his education reforms , including tory plans to scrap gcses and a lib dem scheme to provide free school meals to under-7s . other measures include curbing some of the reforms put in place by mr gove , with the lib dems insisting that all teachers in state-funded schools - including academies and free schools - have qualified status or are working towards it . a slimmed-down core national curriculum would be compulsory in all state schools , bringing free schools and academies in line with those run by councils .
