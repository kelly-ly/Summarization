( cnn ) i remember traveling one day in the local train in mumbai with my mother , my younger sister and brother . i still avoid trains when i can . it is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment . there is , for example , the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss rajendra pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages .
