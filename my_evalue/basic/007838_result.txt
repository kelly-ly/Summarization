easter is over for the wild rabbits of greater sydney as councils and parks prepare another attempt to kill them off with strategically placed carrots that have been laced with a deadly virus . while rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving , about 70-100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus , also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease ( rhd ) , which damages the animal 's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding . about 30 public land managers and councils in sydney , across 160 localities , scattered the infected vegetable in public areas in march , but a second smaller scale program is likely to be implemented in may across 10 areas as well as the central coast .
