sauntering down leafy avenues past typical dutch step-­gabled buildings , carpets of crocuses , the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal , i can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than the hague . much more than a village : the parliament building stands proud in the hague - a hidden gem of a city . this cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes ( i snacked in the juni lekkernijen ) , as well as altogether more assuming ones . for summer : the excellent grapes & olives and the café de bieb on veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal , with music and boat trips planned , including a tour at the kompaan brewery ( i can vouch for the product ) .
