what better way to kick off the week you get married than by settling a pressing matter at work before you relax and prepare for the big day ? the british no1 marries kim sears in dunblane on saturday and , win or lose on sunday , he will be heading straight to the airport to get back and focus on what lies ahead next weekend . his opponent , however , looked incredibly sharp in defusing john isnerâ€™s big serve in the semi-final and djokovic knows recent history is on his side . one thing for sure is that the next big tournament when they face off , two players who have been rivals since before their teenage years will both be married men .
