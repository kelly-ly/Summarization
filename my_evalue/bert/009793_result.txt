channel 4 's indian summers star olivia grant headed to phuket in thailand before the start of filming the second series . phuket , however , is very different from koh phangan . our thai yoga instructor , who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany , performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from couples retreat , for anyone who knows that film . then , after a fabulous dinner at sri panwa’s beautifully appointed thai restaurant soul food , where the ‘ squid on hot plate’ sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for , i submitted to the jet-lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid .
