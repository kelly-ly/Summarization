they worked together to build a model for this ' hybrid spreading ' which accurately predicted patients ' progression from hiv to aids in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off aids . as hiv progresses , it reduces the number of active t-cells in the body until the immune system can not function correctly , a state known as ' acquired immune deficiency syndrome ' or aids . our model suggests that completely blocking cell-to-cell transfer would prevent progression to aids , highlighting the need to develop new treatments . ' laboratory research , led by co-senior author dr clare jolly , has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping hiv from spreading directly between cells .
