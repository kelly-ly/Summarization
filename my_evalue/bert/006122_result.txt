arsene wenger wants cesc fabregas to be shown the ‘ respect he deserves’ when he returns to the emirates stadium in the blue of chelsea on sunday . wenger wants ' respect ' for the club 's former players and counts fabregas as a man who deserves that . extreme , perhaps , but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where fabregas built his career , not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from barcelona to chelsea are still as clear as mud . this club and myself had a very positive influence on cesc’s life , so i would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here . ’
