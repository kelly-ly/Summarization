alastair cook has been working on a new , more open stance with former england batting coach graham gooch over the past few months . england head coach peter moores and cook stand together during a nets session in grenada on monday . in this scenario , because his front foot is still landing as the ball is halfway down , he is forced to play the shot with his hands away from his body , which is when you 're most likely to nick the ball to the wicketkeeper or slips . of course , when you 're in form you do n't think about these things .
