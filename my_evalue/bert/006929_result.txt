as the election race hots up , labour leader ed miliband is getting a small taste of what it might be like to be a member of one direction . perhaps fearing a gaffe , the labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the milifans but did tweet the teen behind it , @ twcuddleston , saying ' hi abby - delighted that you 've joined labour - welcome . ' another , @ helenamelia_xox , said ' if i ever met ed miliband i actually would cry he 's so hot . ' one of the women was heard saying : ' hashtag ed ' and the group erupted into giggles before mr miliband made his excuses and waved goodbye .
