archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of a 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second ottoman-habsburg war . they believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central europe - may have been left in the town of tulln for trading after the siege of vienna in 1683 . the camel was male , around seven years old and most likely castrated . genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a bactrian ( pictured ) -dromedary hybrid â€“ a breed popular in the ottoman army at the time .
