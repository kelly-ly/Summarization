an owl breeder has come up with a novel idea to help him tell his young fledglings apart - by giving them brightly coloured manicures . staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day . we have for instance three tawny owls from one clutch , or family , so we have painted their nails three different colours according to when they were hatched . ' something to remember next time we have a sunday lunch . '
