millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that £85 was not an ' excessively high ' penalty for staying too long in a car park . but for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet , it 's a very heavy and unfair burden . ' professor stephen glaister , director of the rac foundation , said the ruling would hand parking firms a ' blank cheque ' to milk drivers , adding : ' this decision could cost motorists millions . ' if judges believe £85 is not an extravagant amount then what is ? our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers .
