what alastair cook did here , particularly in the first hour of his innings , was spot-on . he has struggled when he has looked to make runs with shots that he rarely employed before . perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket , perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again , but cook has been searching for the ball far too early . meanwhile , jonathan trott still looked a little frenetic at the start of his innings , certainly for those first 10 to 15 runs when he was searching for the ball and driving when he did not need to .
