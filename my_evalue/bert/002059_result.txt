two germanwings flights have been forced to make emergency landings in two days - one over a suspected oil leak and another after a passenger and a cabin crew member fell ill . a statement issued by the cologne-based airline said the pair required medical treatment for ' an acute feeling of sickness ' , disputing reports that the twin-engine plane landed after a nervous passenger suffered a panic attack . once the plane arrived they continued their journey to rome , where the flight landed about five hours late at leonardo da vinci-fiumicino airport .
