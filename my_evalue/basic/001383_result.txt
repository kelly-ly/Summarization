a measure proposed to the oregon legislature would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels , about as loud as a school cafeteria . it also would n't allow hand dryers blowing air downwards to blow air faster than 115 mph , in case the hand-dryer manufacturer does n't label the decibel level . bill sponsor democratic sen. chris edwards told the senate committee on business and transportation that the new generation of hand dryers used to elicit episodes in his autistic son , who would cry and cover his ears when he heard them .
