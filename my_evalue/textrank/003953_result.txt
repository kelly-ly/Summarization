a german man who had his penis enlarged with silicone injections claims it now weighs half a stone . it took him several years to find out about silicone injections , which were only available in london when he first began researching them . however , rather than seeking professional medical help , he met a medical student who agreed to perform the first injections . to date , mr stunz has had four procedures which involved injecting silicone into his penis and scrotum . in fact , a 2012 study in the urology annals , said : ‘ we conclude that penile enhancement procedures with liquid silicone by non-medical personnel could result in devastating consequences . ’ mr stunz said he uses a satchel to cover his modesty and refrains from telling certain people - such as his boss or his extended relations - about his enlarged penis .
