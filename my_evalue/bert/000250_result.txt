( cnn ) this weekend , millions of people are expected to tune in to watch two men beat each other up . some might know that the long-reigning heavyweight champ is a towering ukrainian with a boring jab-happy style , but most would n't come up with his name ( wladimir klitschko ) . if we just wanted blood and pain , we would n't bother with the tame violence of pay-per-view fisticuffs . but many people who feel no temptation to watch internet snuff feel sorely tempted to watch a big fight .
