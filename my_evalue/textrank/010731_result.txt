international stars like brendon mccullum will visit to play t20 cricket this summer , but talk among homegrown players is of how it might save england from further embarrassment in global competitions . i 'm a big fan of the block system for t20 , you dedicate three weeks to a month to hone your skills , all your focus if on t20 . there 's such a heavy schedule of test matches guys do n't get a chance to play domestic t20 .
