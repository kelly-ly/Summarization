ed miliband today rushed to scotland to try to shore up his hope of becoming prime minister as a damning poll showed almost half of scots are ready to back the snp . but mr miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in scotland , 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the snp , with just 25 per cent backing labour , robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority . there has been a surge in support for the snp in the months since the independence referendum in september . but in a joint press conference , mr miliband , his shadow chancellor ed balls and scottish labour leader jim murphy said the snp 's plan ' will mean a Â£7.6 billion hole in scotland 's finances ' .
