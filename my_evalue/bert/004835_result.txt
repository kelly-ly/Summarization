in the midst of the family 's fighting and different claims , bobby brown has made a bold move . while bobby remains adamant his daughter is awake , his ex-wife 's 81-year-old mother has insisted her one time son-in-law is being far too optimistic , saying that even though bobbi is no longer in a coma , she is irreversibly brain damaged and said that only a miracle could save her . however , bobbi kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come . thanks for your prayers , ,still a process , but she is going to be ok ( sic ) .
