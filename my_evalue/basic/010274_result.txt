louis jordan , 37 , who was rescued 200 miles off the north carolina coast , said he survived for more than two months on his stricken boat by eating fish he caught by trailing dirty clothes in the ocean , and by catching rainwater in a bucket . but doubters have questioned how jordan – who declined medical help despite claiming to have broken a shoulder and who appears well-fed , with pale , unblemished skin – seemed in such good shape after such a gruelling ordeal . jordan said his morale was boosted by reading the bible from cover to cover , but claimed he lost 50 lbs after his supply of tinned food ran out and his diet was reduced to raw fish .
