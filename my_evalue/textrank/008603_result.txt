in an interview with mailonline , mr clegg said mr farage 's ' mask is slipping ' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white ' lashing out ' in a scrabble for headlines . but mr clegg condemned the ' worrying ' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the ' far right ' . mr clegg went head to head with mr farage in two tv debates last year , ahead of the european parliament elections , which ukip went on to win while the lib dems lost all but one seat in brussels .
