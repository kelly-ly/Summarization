there is a rich and mildly amusing irony about arsenal fans calling chelsea boring for defending well , when these gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003-04 . instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on chelsea 's title winners , maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players , and in particular mesut ozil . ozil was n't terrible but he did n't impact the game enough . ozil takes on cesar azpilicueta in a game where he was fine , but not good enough to change the result .
