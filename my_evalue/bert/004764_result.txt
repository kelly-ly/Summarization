alastair cook hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as england captain showed how to do it . there was agony for cook on the third day of the second test as he again fell short of the magic three figures despite looking as solid and unflustered at the crease as at any time in the two years since his last century . if trottâ€™s wicket came almost out of the blue when he drove the leg-spin of bishoo to second slip then cook seemed sure to make this the day when he finally threw off any doubts about him at the helm for another ashes . no englishman has ever made seven in succession .
