gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy , forming a highly magnified , though much distorted image . in this particular case , the galaxy known as sdp.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from earth . in this particular case , the galaxy known as sdp.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from earth .
