the jockey they all struggle to beat but also a rider no sane jockey would attempt to emulate . that is the verdict of colleague andrew thornton when trying to explain what has made ap mccoy such a dominant force in his sport . it might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique . he would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well .
