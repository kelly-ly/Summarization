the snp will help make ed miliband prime minister even if labour finish 40 seats behind the tories at the general election , nicola sturgeon said last night . the scottish first minister said she would form an anti-tory alliance with labour and other smaller parties regardless of how many mps david cameron wins on may 7 . while mr miliband has ruled out going into coalition with the snp , ms sturgeon 's remarks raise the prospect of labour ruling as a minority government - despite winning fewer votes and seats than the tories . even if the tories are the largest party , if there is an anti tory majority , my offer to labour is to work together to keep the tories out . ' asked if this would remain her position even if mr cameron had 30 more mps than mr miliband , she confirmed : ' if there is an anti tory majority , yes , that 's what i 've been saying all along - i 'm not sure why there 's any confusion about it - that we would work with labour to stop the tories getting into downing street .
