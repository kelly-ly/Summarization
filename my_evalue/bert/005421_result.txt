the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to contest the masters next week told sportsmail of his immense relief that he held on to claim the last spot . the englishman got in due to staying in the world’s top 50 but at one point , as events unfolded in morocco and at the texas open , he was projected to fall to 54th . on the outside looking in is hardly where you want to be for the season’s first major . but i’m going back a lot wiser and far better equipped if i got in contention again . ’
