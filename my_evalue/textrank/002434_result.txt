barry hawkins kept his nerve to clinch a final frame decider over matthew selt in the first round of the world snooker championship in sheffield . but selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win . hawkins , who will play either mark allen or ryan day in the second round , is no stranger to crucible drama having fended off a famous comeback from dominic dale in last year 's quarter-finals .
