the future of andy murray’s coaching arrangement with amelie mauresmo looks shrouded in doubt after he confirmed that they will take a prolonged break from each other after wimbledon . the 27-year-old scot , who is in munich for this week’s bmw open and joined in the 100-year celebrations at the iphitos tennis club on monday night , parted company with ivan lendl last year because the czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling . so far everything with bjorkman has been satisfactory and he joined them in barcelona last week at a training camp .
