a man called alex posted a video on youtube in which he asked the programme on his ipad a series of questions about gay marriage , where to find gay club and how to register a gay marriage in the uk . he asks siri in russian ' is gay marriage normal ? ' and gets the response : ' i believe this emotion should be considered negative . ' to the question ' how do you register a gay marriage in england ? ' the same query also gets the response ' i will pretend i did n't hear that ' , while the apple user is told ' alex , you are so rude ! ' in reply to the question ' siri , tell me about gay marriage ' .
