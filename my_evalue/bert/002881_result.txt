stuart mccall has sent a warning to bilel mohsni as he insisted rangers will need cool heads for the promotion run-in . i didn’t know what he was booked for and kenny ( black ) had said it was a reaction to their fans . if it’s for tackles you can maybe understand it but we can’t afford cheap bookings for running to the crowd , taking your shirt off , back chat with referees , kicking the ball away – i don’t like things like that . i don’t want people to surrender meekly and mildly .
