an estimated 1,000 allied soldiers died on the first day of the disastrous invasion until january 1916 , when after huge losses on both sides , the allies successfully fooled the turkish forces and evacuated their soldiers from the peninsula . soldiers are seen being hosed down on the deck of the ss river clyde , a mule is hoisted on board the ship and even the moment a soldier makes the dash across no man 's land has been captured for posterity . these photographs , many taken by soldiers , show the true horror of the doomed gallipoli landings during world war one , which claimed the lives of 140,000 troops in eight months of fighting before they eventually withdrew to north africa in january 1916 with no material gain .
