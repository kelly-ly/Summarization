jeremy scott’s spring/summer 2015 collection for moschino caused an insta-stampede , nearly breaking the internet when he sent human barbie dolls down the catwalk . so although donning jeremy scott’s barbie-inspired moschino collection wasn’t as much of an almighty leap for me as it would be for , say , the rest of the world , it still required a certain amount of chutzpah to take it to the streets . navigating the supermarket aisles , she admits she felt like a saucy stepford wife . a cupcake tray ended up in my basket .
