with its stuffed rhino heads and gleaming white tusks , the trophy room at sandringham was a relic of a bygone era – as well as rather embarrassing for animal welfare crusader prince william . following the winter closure , a new sign outside the sandringham museum makes pointed reference to how changing times have spelled the end for some exhibits . after explaining that the museum opened in 1928 to house george v’s collection of ‘ big game trophies’ , the message says : ‘ thankfully , due to the work of organisations like the world wide fund for nature , whose president was hrh prince philip until 1996 , this destructive era is drawing to a close – the camera having replaced the gun in recording the sightings of these magnificent animals . ’ chnging times : now every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display .
