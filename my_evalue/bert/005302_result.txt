earlier this month the tracksuit tycoon mike ashley agreed to buy a plot of land in chelsea from the retailer john lewis for somewhere in the region of £200million . in five years , when the operation to build the properties is concluded and they have been sold to high-end buyers , ashley will add something in the region of another £1bn to his net worth . the money men at newcastle are already aware that the team could play in an empty stadium when the new television deals crystallise at the start of the 2016-17 season and still turn a profit based on current income and expenditure . ashley ( right ) has never been mr popular at st james ' park but the protests have been ramped up recently .
