so you might think mi5 would have more important things to worry about than running a competition for blue peter viewers to go to ‘ spy school’ . jamie , 13 , reuben , 13 , and ten-year-old finley were selected after a series of ‘difficult’ tests to show they are young spies in the making . jamie , from glasgow , added that it ‘ felt really cool because we were making history’ and reuben , from north yorkshire , said : ‘ being there for the very first time cameras have been allowed inside mi5 was an awesome experience and i loved doing it .
