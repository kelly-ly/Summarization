since barbie 's style instagram account launched last august , swarms of fashion lovers have become fans of her ' official style feed ' , watching as the mattel icon models an impressive collection of barbie clothes that even includes pieces by top designers . the idea for barbie 's fashion-focused instagram page came to be when barbie 's vice president of design , kim culmone , realized that in addition to the official @ barbie account - which promotes the brand 's products - the doll could also be presented in a more editorial way , taking inspiration from fashion magazines . along with barbie director of design robert best and zlatan zukanovic , the account 's creative and photography lead , ms. culmone soon grew @ barbiestyle to have even more fans than the original @ barbie page , which has 434,000 followers .
