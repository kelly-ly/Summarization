researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures , by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart . the researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart ( shown above ) . using x-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments . professor ritchie added : ' natural inspiration is a powerful motivation to develop new synthetic materials with unique properties . ' for example , the mechanistic understanding weâ€™ve identified in skin could be applied to the improvement of artificial skin , or to the development of thin film polymers for applications such as flexible electronics .
