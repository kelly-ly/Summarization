madonna received a barrage of criticism from her gay fanbase today after posting a photograph of former prime minister margaret thatcher and ' thanking ' her for her service . some of her fans took umbrage to the photo , which madonna captioned with : ' thank you margaret thatcher ' followed by ' # unapologetic # rebelheart ' and a love heart . the controversy came on the heels of the pop icon likening the leak of her album to a ' form of terrorism ' - her comments coming just after the world was left in shock following a deadly hostage terrorist siege in sydney and the devastating taliban school massacre in pakistan . revolution of love is a track off her album rebel hearts , both of which she used as hashtags at the end of her post .
