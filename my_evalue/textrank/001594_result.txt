i decided i would stop taking my painkillers when pregnant as there was n't 100 per cent proof it would all be okay for baby so i stopped to be on the safe side , ' she explained on my extraordinary pregnancy , which airs tonight on tlc . the pain started when i was quite young and i had the first surgery when i was five . ' growing up i had a lot of hip pain and back pain and initially i did n't know what it was . those with hip dysplasia are five to ten times times more likely to have baby with condition and it 's more common in female and first-born babies .
