the death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times , but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel . however disappointed we may be in the actions of indonesian president joko widodo -- in whom so many inside and outside indonesia have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense . significantly , it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of indonesia 's leaders ability -- or even desire , perhaps -- to use their capacity for state-sanctioned violence .
