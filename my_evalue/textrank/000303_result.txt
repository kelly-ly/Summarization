in 2006 , during his first term , prime minister abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the `` comfort women '' system . last year , i , along with 17 of my house colleagues , wrote to the japanese ambassador to the united states , calling the timing and contents of the japanese government report on the 1993 kono statement : regrettable , unfortunate , unacceptable , and destabilizing . last year , meanwhile , the abe administration tried ( and failed ) to get the united nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report , which called on japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery . to those people i say , in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history , for every step forward the japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation , it takes two steps back .
