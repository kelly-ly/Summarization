modern humans have been blamed for killing off the neanderthals by out competing them , breeding with them and even outright murdering them . neanderthals , like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london , may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to europe by modern humans as they migrated out of africa . a gene that can cause diabetes in latin americans is also thought to have come from neanderthals , long before their ancestors colonised the new world . their study , which is published on the open source database biorxiv , contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock .
