a hat-trick of tries from teenage winger ash handley helped leeds to a handsome 41-16 win over reigning champions st helens that takes them six points clear at the top of super league . handling errors by mark flanagan and adam swift ensured saints remained on the back foot and they fell further behind on 15 minutes when hugely-impressive prop adam cuthbertson kept the ball alive on the last tackle and centre joel moon produced a delightful one-handed pass out of the back of his hands to get handley over again . it got even better for the visitors when makeshift centre carl ablett split open the saints defence to get veteran half-back danny mcguire sprinting over from halfway for a fourth try and this time sinfield , starting as a substitute for the first time for nearly 12 years , added the goal .
