the red planet might still have liquid water , suggests information collected by nasa 's curiosity rover . doctor morten bo madsen , associate professor and head of the mars group at the niels bohr institute at the university of copenhagen in denmark , said : ' we have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and , under the right conditions , it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere . ' our measurements from the curiosity rover 's weather monitoring station show that these conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter . ' based on measurements of humidity and the temperature at a height of 1.6 metres and at the surface of the planet , we can estimate the amount of water that is absorbed . ' when night falls , some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost , but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water , so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid . it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs . viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys .
