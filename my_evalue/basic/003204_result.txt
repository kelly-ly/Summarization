the ' campaign ' continues against chelsea when it comes to penalties â€“ although in a first half with four penalty appeals it was clear that referee , michael oliver was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those . the blues had a good shout for an early penalty when oscar was clipped by bellerin but i agreed with oliver that the contact was accidental and minimal - a penalty would have been very harsh . there was only one clear penalty for me when oscar was played clean through on goal and lobbed david ospina the arsenal keeper clearly wiped oscar out and oliver should have given them a penalty .
