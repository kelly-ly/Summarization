sometime in the next few weeks , louis van gaal has a lunch appointment with sir alex ferguson . on friday he expressed a tongue-in-cheek hope that ferguson will pay but , more pertinently , the current manchester united manager hopes to have some genuine and tangible progress to talk about . they have lost one domestic game in 14 since defeat at southampton on new year’s day , leaving manuel pellegrini’s city team looking rather vulnerable in second position as they try to make something of a season that already has the word ‘disappointment’ written right through it . van gaal will only hope that he is on course for an interesting lunch with the one man who has seen it all , and much more , many times before .
