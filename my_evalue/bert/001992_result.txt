despite being fierce rivals , apple and samsung have a somewhat symbiotic relationship when it comes to manufacturing their handsets . now it has been reported that the korean tech giant will be the main supplier of the a9 chips in apple 's upcoming iphone range . although this is n't the first time samsung has manufactured parts for iphones , it signals that the frosty partnership between the two may be thawing . samsung will supply 80 % of apple 's supply of application processors , with tsmc supplying the remaining 20 % earlier today , samsung announced better-than-expected profits for the first quarter of 2015 thanks to a rising demand for memory chips .
