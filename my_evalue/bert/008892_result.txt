what jason holder did in antigua and marlon samuels managed here will do much for the culture phil simmons is trying to create as new west indies coach . these are the types of innings you remember when you retire . that is what you get in test cricket . this is not to denigrate twenty20 or what we saw at the world cup but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in antigua , with england bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets .
