saturday 's game is absolutely huge for both teams . with no martin skrtel , olivier giroud will be licking his lips . ramsey can grab a goal , and liverpool will have to watch his runs into the box , but henderson will press hard and make sure ramsey and the likes of mesut ozil and santi cazorla have no room to breathe .
