west brom manager tony pulis will receive a hero 's welcome when he returns to crystal palace on saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57-year-old , he must wonder if he 'll ever be successful at the right end of the premier league . for all the expertise pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight , a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of stoke city and palace supporters , his overall record is one of the worst of any long-serving premier league manager . if , as expected , garry monk 's swansea city do n't drop lower than 10th , pulis will be the only manager in the premier league with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th .
