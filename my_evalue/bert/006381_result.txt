like many women , i’ve long dreamed of a bigger bust . not surprisingly , it has gained a following among women like me who would never have surgery but love the idea of trying out a dream decolletage for a day . apparently , rice is about the same weight by volume as surgical implants and can be moulded more realistically to your breast shape . unlike those i usually wear , this has four rows of hooks — presumably to cope with the maximum potential weight — and it takes me a few extra minutes to get them fully done up .
