could these be the boots of a disembodied samurai soldier , lingering mysteriously behind this little girl ? again , not saying that this is what is there , just that , based on preliminary research , this is my best guess ... ' photographs from the same set show the little girl with nothing behind her and the snapper ' swears ' there was nothing behind her at the time . an admin from the toowoomba ghost chasers facebook page posted a negative version of the image , saying : ' light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted.. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child ' . ms davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 .
