the tragic death of a seven-week-old baby in his mother’s bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns . ‘ at the baby’s inquest this week , a coroner in pembrokeshire said new parents were given ‘confusing’ advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child . but very few people will sleep unless they’re actually tired . ’ however professor bob carpenter , from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , has estimated that around 120 cot deaths could be prevented every year in the uk if parents were advised not to co-sleep .
