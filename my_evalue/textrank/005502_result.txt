yes , we both had failures , but i 'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end . ' to be able to race other cars , and see the red bulls until a long way into the race , was good . ' it 's what i enjoy and hopefully race by race we 'll start picking them off . ' despite the positives , button acknowledges the entire team , including honda , ' still has a long way to go ' . so we 're moving in the right direction , and i 'm already surprised we are racing cars .
