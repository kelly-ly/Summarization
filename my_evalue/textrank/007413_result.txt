the annual fire festival lasts for 11 days and sees dozens of participants dangle over the flames while a hindu priest uses oil to stoke the blaze as he chants religious hymns . ' an ardent participant , 52-year-old munna kirkey , said that participants have to adhere to a strict diet to prepare for what is known as agni pareeksha , meaning trial by fire . ' we start consuming bengal gram and jaggery sorbet 10 days before the trial starts and stay away from sinning , ' mr kirkey said . ' hanging over the fire is the ultimate test of our austerity ... if participants do n't follow the rules they will vomit during the fire test and may even get burns , ' he added .
