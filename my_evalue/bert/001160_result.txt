two warring sisters were yesterday stripped of the right to control their aged mother’s fortune because of the intensity of the hatred between them . senior judge denzil lush said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document , so she could gain greater control over her mother’s money . instead he appointed a court deputy to carry out this role . laura knight of the opg told the court that ‘ it is more difficult to believe that a professional person with the responsibilities of the gp would misunderstand the difference in appointment types’ .
