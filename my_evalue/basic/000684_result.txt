dr. kristen lindsey allegedly shot an arrow into the back of an orange tabby 's head and posted a proud photo this week on facebook of herself smiling , as she dangled its limp body by the arrow 's shaft . callers rang the phones hot at washington county 's animal clinic , where lindsey worked , to vent their outrage . then an animal rescuer said that lindsey 's prey was probably not a feral cat but the pet of an elderly couple , who called him `` tiger .
