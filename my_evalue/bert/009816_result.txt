arsenal are the form team in europe at present , winning 10 games out of their last 11 , including seven in a row . but could there be something else ? cazorla 's track choice may be slightly more old school , but that 's nothing compared to theo walcott . the england forward is obviously loungin ' before games with his selection of ll cool j 's 1996 summer hip-hop tune , which does n't quite posses the fast pace we expect from walcott on the pitch .
