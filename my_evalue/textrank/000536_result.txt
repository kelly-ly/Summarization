a japan railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour ( 374 miles per hour ) on an experimental track in yamanashi tuesday , setting a decisive new world record . a spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour , during which it covered 1.8 kilometers ( 1.1 miles ) . unlike traditional trains , maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward .
