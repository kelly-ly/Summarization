leighton aspell became the first jockey in more than 40 years to win back-to-back grand nationals when many clouds galloped to a famous victory in the aintree sunshine . the runners are seen off the mark by a capacity aintree crowd on saturday afternoon . monbeg dude , seventh last year , stayed on gallantly into third place to give the raceâ€™s youngest trainer michael scudamore another big day in the sun , while alvarado finished in exactly the same position as 12 months ago to complete an incredible seven timer for rider paul moloney who has now finished in the first four in the last seven nationals . it was a day out for the whole family for this group as racegoers young and old enjoyed their day out during grand national day .
