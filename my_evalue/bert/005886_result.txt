a bloodstained document revealing a life-or-death episode that could have derailed the whole us space programme of the 1960s is tipped to sell for Â£80,000 ( $ 120,000 ) . the gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the apollo missions . but the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when white was back inside . the spacewalk checklist for the gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to mcdivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago .
