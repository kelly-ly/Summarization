the prickly australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the mornington peninsula , 83 km south of melbourne . they like the water so much , that the zoo built a special swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days . echidnas , like many native australian animals , are actually ' proficient ' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean .
