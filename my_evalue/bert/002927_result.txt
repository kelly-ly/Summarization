the turin shroud , one of christianity 's most celebrated and hotly-debated relics , went on display to the public on sunday for the first time in five years . more than one million people have already booked their slots to see the piece of linen that devotees believe to be the burial cloth of jesus christ between now and june 24 . ' imprinted with the image of a man who appears to have been crucified , the shroud has been dated to the end of the 13th century , lending support to those who say it is a medieval forgery . local authorities are counting on the exhibition of the shroud in the city 's cathedral to give a significant boost to the local economy at a time of stagnation across italy .
