a day that featured a fourth test century in only his ninth match for gary ballance ended with the leader of england’s attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with sir ian botham’s test record . they still have much to do and all results remain possible but england will be much the happier with west indies finishing on 98 for two , still a massive 340 short of recreating antiguan test history . smith lives to fight another day on 59 and it should be pointed out that he too was in west indies side that famous day in 2003 when history was made on this island .
