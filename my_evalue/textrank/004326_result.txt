andrew chan , pictured aged 21 , and myuran sukumaran , 24 , pictured during their first trial in october of 2005 , were both attracted to drug smuggling by the promised riches , after being disillusioned by their jobs . thirteen years since their fateful first meeting , after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected , the ringleaders of the infamous bali nine and their tragic tale will shortly come to an end . but a two year long wait amounted to nothing as both men had their pleas reject by joko widodo , who was elected in july of 2014 and by december had announced his hard-line stance on drug smugglers . the pleas of australian prime minister tony abbott , foreign minister julie bishop and the grand mufti of australia , dr ibrahim abu mohamed , fell on deaf ears as mr widodo repeatedly made his stance on drug smugglers clear - there would be no mercy .
