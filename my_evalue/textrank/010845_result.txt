one of the men accused of killing alexander litvinenko claimed today that the russian spy 's death may have been an ' accidental suicide ' after he inadvertently handled polonium . dmitri kovtun , who is wanted for the dissident 's murder , insisted that he was not involved in mr litvinenko 's death and suggested that he had poisoned himself without knowing it . mr litvinenko met with kovtun and alexander lugovoi , another former spy , in london shortly before he fell ill with radiation poisoning in november 2006 and died at the age of 43 . at a press conference in russia today , kovtun asserted his innocence and blamed mr litvinenko for his own death - saying he was carrying around polonium rather than being given it by kovtun and lugovoi , as has been previously claimed . the inquiry has previously heard that mr litvinenko ingested polonium-210 when he drank a cup of tea during a meeting with the two ex-kgb men at the millennium hotel in central london .
