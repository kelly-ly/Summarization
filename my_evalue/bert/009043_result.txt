lord of the rings and hobbit fans who canâ€™t afford to travel to themed attractions on the other side of the world can find a slice of middle-earth on the american frontier . located in trout creek , about 100 miles south of the us-canada border , the tiny home has custom-made wooden furniture , a stove and barbecue for cooking and cosy rooms with round doors , and has no mobile phone service as it is completely underground . the owner transformed the house into a shrine for fans of jrr tolkien 's books after a friend told him it looked like a hobbit house . in the woods surrounding the guest house , visitors may spot everything from deer and elk to mountain lions and bears .
