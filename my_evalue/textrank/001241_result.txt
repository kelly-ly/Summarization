livingston gave rangers a headache last week when they held them to a 1-1 draw at the energy assets arena and they now take on hibernian in midweek . the easter road outfit slipped four points behind mccall 's side on saturday while they were busy getting knocked out of the william hill scottish cup by falkirk as rangers were winning 3-1 at dumbarton in league action . i 'm delighted for the kid and hopefully that 's him on his way to a lot of goals for rangers .
