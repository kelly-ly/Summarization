audi has created a so-called ' green ' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide . experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as ' blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel . the hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures . by capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air , audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere .
