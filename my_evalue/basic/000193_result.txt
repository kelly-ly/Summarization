tokyo ( cnn ) with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the u.s. congress , the first ever by a japanese prime minister , shinzo abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history . during this 70th year anniversary of the end of world war ii , abe has been disappointing on japan 's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for japan 's wartime actions in asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive . many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but abe is mounting a significant retreat from japan 's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education .
