mrs woods , a full-time mother , said : ' i thought she was joking , but elisha made me go and have a look , so i went and checked the bin and nothing was there . ' within an hour , a local woman who keeps snakes had recognised her plight and identified the reptile as a corn snake , a non-venomous species normally kept as a pet . it is not clear how the snake ended up in the bathroom , but ms woods believes that the previous tenant may have kept snakes as pets and lost the red and orange reptile while moving .
