chip shop boss john clarkson has created a new answer to the creme egg question of ' how do you eat yours ? ' - eschewing the savoury favourites of sausage and egg or mince pies , mr clarkson decided to wrap the easter delicacies in pastry before they were battered and deep-fried . the 55-year-old fryer , says the savoury-sweet mix is a hit with customers , who have taken to dipping chips into the creme egg ' yolk ' like traditional toast soldiers . it 's a laugh and i always like seeing what i can conjure up next for customers that might be seen as a bit strange or unusual .
