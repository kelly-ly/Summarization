some of our most spectacular views of mars have been presented on small , skinny strips of imagery . the new map allows astronomers to ' stand ' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across the red planet . constructing a 3d model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle . pictured is the the strip up top of mc11 , showing the ares vallis region , in the context of the rest of the region covered by the dlr 's wide area topography survey .
