a new islamic fatwa in turkey has decreed that muslims are allowed to use toilet paper . the set of rules for how muslims should relieve themselves , called the qadaa al-haajah , was established in the times before toilet paper or toilet seats were invented . the new announcement , reported by hurriyet daily news , stated : ' if water can not be found for cleansing , other cleaning materials can be used . ' ' even though some sources deem paper to be unsuitable as a cleaning material , as it is an apparatus for writing , there is no problem in using toilet paper .
