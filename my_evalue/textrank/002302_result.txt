the odds of regular e-cigarette use were 100 times higher among current weekly smokers than among non-smokers , and 50 times higher among those who had smoked cannabis . the strong link between current smoking and e-cigarette use suggests that teens are not using these products to help them quit smoking , the researchers said . e-cigarettes do not attract non-smokers . ' professor paul aveyard , at the university of oxford , said : ' this study shows that teenagers do what teenagers do : they experiment with smoking and nowadays also with e-cigarettes . ' consequently some people who have never tried tobacco cigarettes try e-cigarettes but only a few use them at least monthly , suggesting they are unattractive to people who do not smoke . ' about a fifth of regular smokers are using e-cigarettes , which is not a concern because e-cigarettes are less likely to harm users than are tobacco cigarettes . '
