although is not unusual for middle-aged orangutans to have arthritis , doctors had to anaesthetise suma in order to check how her condition has progressed over the past two years . suma was treated by orthopaedic surgeon and associate professor marino pirpiris , who usually treats humans , and senior vet dr helen mccracken . x-rays were taken in areas where the orangutan has arthritis , her hips and ankles , as dr pirpiris then gave the ape a steroid injection which will reduce her pain for months and perhaps even years .
