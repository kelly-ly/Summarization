( cnn ) c-span 's live telecast of the white house correspondents ' association dinner on saturday night , hosted by cecily strong of `` saturday night live , '' was not strong 's finest hour , though the entire affair seemed like five of c-span 's longest hours . obama was nailing his own punch lines frequently , and perfectly . it was a clever surprise , and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm ( i would n't have presumed most of them knew of key 's character or his series ) , though key 's jokes lost something in the translation , and did n't pack the punch of obama 's . and i was already home .
