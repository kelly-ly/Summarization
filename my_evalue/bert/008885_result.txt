jeremy clarkson , james may and richard hammond today held talks with top gear executive producer andy wilman - just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the bbc . the 52-year-old said the bbc would be ‘stupid’ to try a version of the programme with ' a surrogate jeremy ' , hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘non-starter’ . earlier this month , north yorkshire police said that following an investigation clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel in hawes .
