( cnn ) the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . al-shabaab ( literally `` the youth '' ) split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so-called islamic courts union . to the contrary , ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of somalia -- although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union -- enabled al-shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign `` christian '' invasion . it is important to counter al-shabaab directly , including by military means .
