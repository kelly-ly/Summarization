online blogging sensation zoella has come under fire from jamie oliver 's company over adverts for unhealthy foods that appear next to her vlogs on youtube . although some of these are for harmless products such as dolmio pasta sauce or hair dye , others are for haribo , coca-cola and for an online gambling website , according to the independent newspaper . last year , she published her book girl online , which recorded record sales for a first-time author . although the advertising standard authority ( asa ) currently prevents food that is high in fat , salt or sugar from being advertised on television shows that appeal to children under 16 , there are no guidelines about video bloggers , despite their growing influence .
