it was another momentous night in barcelona 's proud european history , neymar and luis suarez rampaging through paris saint-germain 's defence to put one foot in the champions league semi-finals . and it will come as little surprise that argentine superstar lionel messi is way out in front in the breakdown of barcelona champions league scorers with 75 , the joint-most in the tournament with cristiano ronaldo . brazilian star rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals , followed by patrick kluivert ( 20 ) , luis enrique ( 19 ) and samuel eto'o ( 16 ) .
