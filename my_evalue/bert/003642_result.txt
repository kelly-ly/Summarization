it is still der klassiker - but not quite as we know it . therein lies the problem - these two have experienced contrasting seasons in the extreme , to the point where the transferable klassiker tag could soon be applied to another fixture - perhaps bayern vs wolfsburg or bayern vs monchengladbach . but those great moments seem a long time ago now and the fixture is harder to hype without so much riding on it . another source of optimism for klopp is bayern 's mounting injury list , with winger franck ribery , who has a recurring ankle problem , joining arjen robben and david alaba on the sidelines .
