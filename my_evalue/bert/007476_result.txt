what we may be witnessing in these opening jousts of the season is the mental disintegration of nico rosberg as a racing driver . that changed in the aftermath of spa last august , when rosberg was punished by the team ( he was made to pay for the damage caused rather than fined as such , contrary to everyoneâ€™s interpretation at the time ) for his part in an early crash with hamilton . it was my view then and remains so that rosberg was marginally more to blame for the collision , but that it was no more than a racing incident . and he is on form now , perhaps more so than ever in his life .
