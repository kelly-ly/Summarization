in an unprecedented move , russia has cancelled the release of a hollywood thriller set in the stalin era - claiming it distorts history and would air as the country celebrates its victory over nazi germany . the film , ' child 44 ' , starring tom hardy , vincent cassel and gary oldman , tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the stalin era . films such as ' child 44 ' should not go out in our country on mass release , earning money from our cinema audiences , not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory , not ever , ' culture minister vladimir medinsky wrote on the ministry 's website .
