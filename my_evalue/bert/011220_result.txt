there was a time when the name of juventus would be one to avoid in the semi-final of european competition . booked : bernardo , kondogbia . before this tie against monaco , the italian world cup winning goalkeeper spoke about the honour and prestige for juventus if they could reach the semi-final . kondogbia was awesome here and anyone who can outshine pirlo , save for the odd killer pass for tevez or alvaro morata , in the centre of midfield must be doing something right .
