strangely absent from the story , of course , is any reference to the role the num played in bringing down successive british governments — both conservative and labour alike — and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped britain in the seventies and culminated in the winter of discontent . nor is there any mention of the attempt by arthur scargill , the loony-left leader of the num , to persuade communist russia — not to mention colonel gaddafi — to bankroll the strike , which his members hadn’t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot . is it any wonder that such films make ed miliband , brought up by a marxist academic father , ‘blub’ ? we are not a drab , depressed country , riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality , as you would think from watching films such as pride and billy elliot .
