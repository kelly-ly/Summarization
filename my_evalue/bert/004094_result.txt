tv insiders say lily james ( pictured ) , who stars in the new disney cinema hit cinderella , would be ideal as mary in the new tv adaptation . he plans another heady tv mix of romance , class struggle and social snobbery , this time based on the work of anthony trollope , one of britain 's greatest novelists . it is romantic and funny and i am absolutely delighted to be doing it . mary has grown up alongside the gresham sisters – augusta , beatrice and alexandrina – and their handsome brother frank , whose home is the great house and estate at greshamsbury park .
