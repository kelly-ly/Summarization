while most people are used to hiding chocolate eggs and enjoying dinner with family and friends , easter celebrations in parts of the world can take on a very different appearance . the ritual is known as v√≠zbeveto , or water plunge monday , where boys throw water over girls and spank them with pussy willow branches on easter monday , and then the girls return the favour on easter tuesday . however , the several hundred years ' old tradition of the hungarian villages has evolved and now often sees young men sprinkle water on the women , who , in exchange , present the men with brightly coloured eggs on easter monday .
