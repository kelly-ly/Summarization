there was no special treatment for lewis ferguson at paul nicholls’s yard on thursday morning . ferguson’s spectacular double somersault fall from the favourite merrion square in the 4.20pm at wincanton has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online . i couldn’t work out what had happened until i got back to the weighing room and watched the replay . all the other jockeys asked me if i was all right and stuff , they all watched with me and looked away in horror .
