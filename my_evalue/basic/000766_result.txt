( cnn ) given that most people could n't tell the difference between a copyright and a trademark , it usually takes something controversial , such as the washington redskins ' refusal to change their name , to get people interested in trademark law . this week , a higher court scrutinized a lesser-known trademark -- when the band the slants sought to protect its name . unfortunately , a bureaucrat at the u.s. patent and trademark office decided that `` slant '' was disparaging to asians , and denied them a trademark registration under the despised ( by me , anyhow ) section 2 ( a ) of the trademark act .
