theresa may warned last night that lives will be in danger if britain is saddled with a hung parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws . mrs may said that , in the worst scenario , the decision would be in the hands of a minority ed miliband government propped up by the snp – which is opposed to new data retention powers , her comments follow a controversial warning by defence secretary michael fallon that labour might be unable to renew the trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on nicola sturgeon’s snp – as the polls say is highly likely . in the wake of the snowden controversy , some technology firms have been reluctant to help the security services . mrs may will hope her intervention sharpens minds with less than a week to go .
