a north korean propaganda unit said the u.s. ambassador to south korea could face a ' bigger mishap ' than the knife attack to his face last month if he does not stop insulting north korea with ' laughable ' accusations . u.s. envoy mark lippert said in a speech on wednesday that if north korea improves its human rights record and takes steps to end its nuclear program , it will be rewarded with prosperity and better ties with the outside world , including the united states . north korea previously called the attack ' deserved punishment ' but denied any role in it .
