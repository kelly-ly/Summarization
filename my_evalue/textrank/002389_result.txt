their study finds the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones . research found that the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones . the experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) – which provides detailed images of internal body structures – and was humorously dubbed by those involved as the ‘ pull my finger study . ’ biomedical engineering professor richard thompson said : ‘ rapid imaging with mri was ideal for these studies because it allowed clear visualization of the bones and fluids surrounding them , and critically , the formation of the air cavity . ’
