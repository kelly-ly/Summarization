in villages in senegal and elsewhere across west africa , young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in europe , perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it . eritreans and syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to europe last year , according to arezo malakooti , director of migration research at altai consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns . one reason is that other routes -- through saudi arabia and to israel -- have become more difficult : israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the sinai desert , including detention , and yemen 's implosion has cut off that conduit .
