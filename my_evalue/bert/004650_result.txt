it is exactly a year since sportsmail revealed that david moyes was getting the sack at manchester united , the club deciding to take action as soon as a defeat at everton meant champions league qualification was no longer possible . decisions . robin van persie felt he was over-trained , though he was careful not to publicly criticise moyes , but others like rio ferdinand were not shy about voicing complaints over issues like when the team was announced . it is hard to know exactly what goes on in the inner sanctum but it does appear van gaal is highly respected by his united squad .
