padding such a long way back was a tall order for a little lapdog with stumpy legs . because the seven-year-old was microchipped , rspca staff were able to trace his owner , kirsty mitton , in wednesbury , west midlands â€“ the opposite end of the m40 from where he was found in gerrards cross , buckinghamshire . the two dogs were the only things taken in the break-in . lillie has not been spayed so can still breed .
