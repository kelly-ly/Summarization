to be raped by your cousin 's husband ; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married ; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault , but be pardoned by presidential decree ; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame . instead of a new start , what followed for gulnaz was a quiet , afghan solution to the `` problem '' -- a telling sign of where women 's rights stand in afghanistan despite the billions that have poured into this country from the u.s. government and its nato allies during more than a decade of war . smile , the name of the daughter born of the rape , is now a shining little girl , bouncing around the house that her mother shares with asadullah 's first wife -- who is also gulnaz 's cousin .
