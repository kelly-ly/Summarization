over the years i’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in lorena ochoa and laura davies . but none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with charley hull , the best teenage golfer in britain . the 19-year-old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the trump family , who recently purchased turnberry , under the guidance of course architect martin ebert . her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 — the year mcilroy reached the summit — which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in america on sunday .
