helping children to get safely to school as a lollipop man might seem the ideal job for an active pensioner nearing his 80th birthday . genti rustemi , 45 , ( left ) left john doyle , 79 , ( right ) with a broken rib and a punctured lung after attacking the lollipop man as he helped children cross the road to get to school . but after rustemi had dropped off his daughter at a different school , he returned to the crossing minutes later in a fit of temper and attacked mr doyle , who was still helping pupils cross the road . it was n't until later in hospital having an x-ray they discovered that i had broken my rib .
