for 43 years cuba has provided refuge for hill from facing charges that he killed a new mexico police officer and hijacked an airliner to havana . critics of the new opening to cuba say havana 's harboring of fugitives like charlie hill is enough of a reason to maintain a hard line against the government of raul castro and keep cuba on the state department list of countries that support terrorism . hill , now 65 , may extradite himself first , saying the warming of relations between the united states and cuba could mean an end to what he calls his `` exile '' on the communist-run , caribbean island , even if his return brings jail time .
