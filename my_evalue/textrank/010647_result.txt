mr miliband said he would have to pay the proposed £250 a month ' mansion tax ' on homes worth more than £2million but claimed this did not mean he actually lived in one . by contrast mr cameron 's house in west london home would narrowly escape the mansion tax , being valued at £1.971million . under labour 's plan , people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £2million or more .
