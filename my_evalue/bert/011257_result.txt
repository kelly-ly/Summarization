children as young as three are being asked to sign a contract pledging not to use transphobic language at school . it is understood that teachers at the south-east london school introduced the document to help stamp out playground prejudice against transgender people and a wide range of disabilities and cultures . but yesterday the chairman of governors said that they knew nothing about the change to the contract , which was also dismissed as ‘bonkers’ by parents who said pre-school children could not be expected to understand such complex issues .
