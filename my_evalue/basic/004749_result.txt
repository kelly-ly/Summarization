rather than lightening as early humans migrated north from africa around 40,000 years ago due to lower levels of sunlight , these first homo sapiens retained their dark skin colour . dna analysis obtained from ancient human remains has shown that as these farmers bred with the dark skinned hunter gatherers , one of these genes became prevalent in the european population and european 's skin colour began to lighten . around 5,800 years ago the second gene , which makes skin colour lighter still , also began to spread though the european population .
