tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in south america , the tiny fishing village of jose ignacio is almost unknown around the world . owing its heritage to a mix of portuguese and spanish colonialism - the two battled over its strategic location - it is a maze of pretty cobbled streets , bougainvillea-draped buildings and a crumbling lighthouse with panoramic views . but the quirky capital does have some of the buzz of its rival across the water buenos aires , with a beautiful 19th century market near the port crammed with restaurants serving asado ( barbecue beef ) and endless bottles of wine .
