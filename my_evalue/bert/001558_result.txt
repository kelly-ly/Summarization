they say the couple who trains together , stays together - and that 's certainly the case for super fit ali gordon and his girlfriend , lydia millen . i think it 's so easy for people to assume starving yourself of food is the best way to stay slim when in fact more of the right food is more important due to the importance of health inside and out . ' so within the week lydia was heading up to my city for a friends party and asked me to come and join for the celebrations , so it was really nice relaxed and easy way to meet for the first time . ' when it comes to other body parts we tend to split up as my training style does n't match lydia 's , it 's nice to be in the gym together though she rocks a gym outfit very well . '
