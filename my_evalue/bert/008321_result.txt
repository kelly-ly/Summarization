shocking footage has emerged of the terrifying moment two people stood in a tiny dinghy while a six metre great white shark charged them . a film crew shooting the documentary lair of the megashark were just off new zealand 's stewart island when they attempted to put a camera on the dorsal fin of the massive ocean predator who decided to nudge the boat and bite at the thin rope that tethered the dinghy to the main boat . last year the department of conservation only granted permits to two cage diving operators under the condition that they observe strict regulations around feeding and using decoys .
