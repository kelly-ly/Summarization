jesus christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist . mystery : this painting depicts jesus christ as single person but writer david fitzgerald believes he was a literary invention that combined the stories from several cults and figures in judea during the first century . there were certainly people writing about judea at the time like philo of alexandria . ' during this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than jesus , but all of them managed something jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record . ' two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did . ' the earliest mention of jesus yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words ' james , son of joseph , brother of jesus ' is inscribed .
