( cnn ) the question : how can i know if my food is safe to eat after a specific product recall ? the answer : many of us shed a few tears over the recent sabra hummus recall ( even though we are perfectly capable of making our own at home ) , but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf . each report will list recalled items with their product codes , which are typically categorized by the universal product code ( the number adjacent to the barcode ) or the stock keeping unit ( a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold ) .
