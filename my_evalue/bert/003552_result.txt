johnny manziel was spotted for the first time since being released from rehab . according to espn , manziel was ' doing great ' in rehab , and had the full support of his team . and while his season may have been over at that time , many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami on over the new year holiday , alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend colleen crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano . it should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by espn in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college , manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem , seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks .
