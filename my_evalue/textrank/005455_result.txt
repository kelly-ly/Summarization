the game was designed to test cognitive flexibility , which is our ability to shift attention , select information and alter our response strategy to fit the changing demands of a task . children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility , ' the study says . â€˜ further , increasing saturated fat intake and dietary cholesterol were correlated with greater switch costs ( such as the difference in performance and accuracy between repeating a task and switching a task ) , reflecting impaired ability to maintain multiple task sets in working memory and poorer efficiency of cognitive control processes involved in task switching .
