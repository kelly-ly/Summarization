three 's company : rebecca and husband harry settle in at anantara the palm jumeirah . my husband harry and i knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time . because it has over-the-water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the maldives , but when we went to the australian themed restaurant , i imagined i was back in the jungle on i 'm a celebrity â€” even though there were n't any luxuries in that jungle .
