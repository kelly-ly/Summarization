i conducted a poll on my radio show recently , and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe manchester united will win the title next season . the dutchman knows , however , he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by david moyes . at centre half , phil jones and chris smalling might become the trusted partnership , or wisdom may win the day and united could go and get mats hummels from borussia dortmund . angel di maria ( centre ) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for united .
