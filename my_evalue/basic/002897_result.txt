next summer there will be a new ship in the thomson fleet – but it will be familiar to seasoned cruisers who have sailed on royal caribbean’s splendour of the seas . so many newly constructed floating resorts come out of shipyards these days – britannia , anthem of the seas and norwegian escape all this year – and it is good news that tried and tested , smaller ships built on classic lines do not just sail off into the sunset or to the breaker’s yard , but are reinvented and relaunched , sometimes several times over . it is hard to believe that luxurious little hebridean princess , chartered by the queen for her 80th birthday family cruise around scotland in 2006 , was the busy car ferry and royal mail ship mv columba for 25 years from its launch in 1964 until transformed in 1989 into the country-house hotel-style cruise ship she is today .
