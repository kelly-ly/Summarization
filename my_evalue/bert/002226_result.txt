it is not the typical place you would expect to find a bird nest , but this blue tit is busy creating hers - inside a lamp post . this little blue tit collected moss , grass and straw to line a nest in a damaged street light near copenhagen . jeanette rosenquist was on her way to work from her home just outside copenhagen , denmark , when she spotted the bird flying out of the lamp post . the female blue tit usually builds the nest by herself with very little help , or no help at all , from the male .
