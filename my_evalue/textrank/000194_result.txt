the democrats were , and have continued to , losing their traditional base of campaign support -- organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s , providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns . without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing , many democrats concluded they needed business by their side . this is why campaign finance reform is so important , without congress changing the fundamental dynamics , there wo n't be much room for populism to thrive . reform could level the playing field . more often than not , campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support .
