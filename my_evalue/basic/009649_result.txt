there looked to be so much bend on leo messi’s shot on the half hour at the nou camp on wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man’s feet . the argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against almeria and with marc bartra heading in either side of two luis suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for messi 's strike - barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners . barcelona ( 4-3-3 ) : bravo ; alves , bartra , mascherano , adriano ; sergi roberto , xavi , rakitic ; messi , suarez , pedro .
