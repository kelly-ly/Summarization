lionel messi , neymar and luis suarez is a star-studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have , but when the going gets tough , barcelona turn to jeremy mathieu and gerard pique . for some reason sergio alvarez , celta vigo 's goalkeeper , is kryptonite for barcelona 's attacking trident , as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the camp nou earlier this season . however , the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary xavi early in the second half . orellana cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker , unmarked , nine yards out , lacked composure , hacking at it and sending it into the vigo night sky .
