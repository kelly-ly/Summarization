a laser could be mounted on the international space station and used to shoot down pieces of space debris in earth orbit , says a new paper . accidental events have also contributed to the problem . if that goes well , we plan to install a full-scale version on the iss , incorporating a three-meter [ 10ft ] telescope and a laser with 10,000 fibres , giving it the ability to deorbit debris with a range of approximately 100 kilometers [ 62 miles ] , â€™ said lead researcher dr toshikazu ebisuzaki . mailonline has asked the researchers to explain how often the laser would fire , and what its maximum capacity in terms of debris-size to deorbit would be .
