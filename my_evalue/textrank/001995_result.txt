next day i decided to cheat and cut short the itinerary . after trekking through the beautiful spelunca gorge , i caught a cab to the seaside resort of porto where a 16th century genoese tower stands guard over the harbour . we sailed along the calanques , a series of rocky inlets , caves and sea cliffs which have been sculpted into exotic shapes by constant erosion . the stunning coastline of corsica that has been sculpted by constant erosion .
