researchers have found that twisted bands of magnetic fuel reach the surface of the sun every two years - in addition to its existing 11-year cycle . this combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle , causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , pictured , and solar flares that can endanger earth . the new solar season occurs when twisted , ring-shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun .
