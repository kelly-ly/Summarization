alastair cook hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as england captain showed how to do it . here he took advantage of the solid platform that had been painstakingly laid by cook and jonathan trott to give england a chance of going on to the sort of total that could put pressure on west indies on the final day . the brutal reality is that only mike brearley among england captains and opening batsmen has gone longer without a hundred than cookâ€™s 34 innings and he had the advantage of being considered the best leader of them all .
