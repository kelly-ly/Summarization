michael vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of england cricket . if vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and , if the position does remain , it is impossible to envisage peter moores surviving even if england win their test series against west indies . alastair cook has often been a target of vaughanâ€™s sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as england captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of test matches quickly .
