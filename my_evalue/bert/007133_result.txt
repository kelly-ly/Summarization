real madrid are desperate to land manchester united goalkeeper david de gea , but they are prepared to wait until next summer if louis van gaal wo n't negotiate , according to reports in spain . although the european champions would like to sign de gea this june , they are looking at the possibility of picking up chelsea 's petr cech to fill the gap in between , while the spaniard runs down his contract at old trafford , which expires next year . cech , meanwhile , looks certain to leave stamford bridge this summer , with the czech keeper likely to command a fee of around Â£10million . elsewhere in spain the focus is on lionel messi 's injury , which is still causing him some problems ahead of barcelona 's trip to celta vigo on sunday .
