( cnn ) i 've visited nepal at least half a dozen times over the last decade , and of the more than 100 countries that save the children serves , it is undoubtedly one of my favorites . it is still quite cold at night in nepal , so getting these people into shelters quickly will be of the utmost importance . compounding this very serious problem will be the difficulty in ensuring that those affected have access to clean water in the coming days ; nepal already had one of the lowest standards of sanitation in the world before the quake . we have been in situations like this before , and know what to do .
