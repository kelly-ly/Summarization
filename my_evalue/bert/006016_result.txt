goodness knows how many times at white hart lane i’ve felt like falling to my knees at the back of the west stand and banging my head on the floor . one of the men , solicitor asif bodi , 46 , from preston , explained that because the televised game didn’t kick off until 4pm , the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground . at this rate , it won’t be long before muslim fans start demanding special prayer rooms at football grounds , just as there are already in public buildings and police custody suites . maybe it would be better if he challenged him to a vodka drinking contest .
