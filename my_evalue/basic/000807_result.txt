but this catholic had n't read it -- at least , not from cover to cover . my excuse always has been that catholics have their bible passages read to them at mass every sunday . in that newsroom conversation this week , daniel burke , the religion editor at cnn.com , suggested i read the bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for belief .
