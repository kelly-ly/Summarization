for instance whether the chinese grand prix is held as a potential title decider late on in the year ( 2004-2008 ) or as an early opener ( 2009-present ) it can often be hit with outside variables ; wet conditions often sprinkling some unpredictability over a weekend . even the pit lanes can be challenging ( you 'll see if you scroll down ) which brings us nicely on to the latest in sportsmail 's series of grand prix memories ... the shanghai circuit held the inaugural chinese grand prix in 2004 and has been home to the event ever since . given the dominance of ferrari at the time , very few would have guessed that rubens barrichello 's 2004 win would be his last for the team .
