( cnn ) tuesday is equal pay day , the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women 's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for `` lost '' wages as a result of the so-called wage gap . still , conservatives -- and by extension republicans -- ought to be paying attention to equal pay day . but nothing could be further from the truth . the independent women 's forum conducted a randomized , controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap , and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the paycheck fairness act -- a legislative `` solution '' to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for democrats .
