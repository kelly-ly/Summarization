europe has been urged to copy australia 's military-led ' stop the boats ' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the mediterranean . migrant boats approaching australian waters are turned back by the navy or sometimes even towed back to where they came from . any vessels which manage to get close are taken under naval escort to the pacific islands of nauru or papua new guinea , where they are detained while migrants ' asylum claims are processed . one of the architects of australia 's tough border policies , retired army major-general jim molan , said european leaders were guilty of ' incompetence ' .
