hot spot for methane emissions in this map showing how much emissions varied from average background concentrations from 2003-2009 ( dark colors are lower than average ; lighter colors are higher ) . the next-generation airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer ( avirisng ) , which observes spectra of reflected sunlight , flies at a higher altitude and will be used to map methane at fine resolution over the entire region . using this information and ground measurements from the other research teams , the hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer ( hytes ) will fly over suspected methane sources , making additional , highly sensitive measurements of methane . part of president obama 's recent climate action plan calls for reductions in methane emissions .
