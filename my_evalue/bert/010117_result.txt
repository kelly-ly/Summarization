a map that reveals every official sighting of a ufo over the past 76 years suggests that we are experiencing more cosmic traffic than ever before . it is worth noting , however , that some famous sightings are missing , such as reports of flying saucers over washington dc in 1952 . the cia said that ufo sightings were directly correlated to them testing u2 spy planes at altitudes of 60,000 ft ( 18,288 metres ) - a feat of engineering that was not possible before . in europe , the map shows many sightings over belgium , between 1989 and 1990 , which is known as the belgium wave .
