arsenal legend paul merson has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown and admitted he was wrong to criticise the england call up for andros townsend . it was the perfect riposte after merson said in his sky sports column : ' if andros townsend can get in ( the england squad ) then it opens it up for anybody . ' how can you tell me that a manager goes and watches man united against tottenham , the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes , the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for england and ashley young does n't get in the squad ? '
