step forward leicester city striker jamie vardy . i’ve seen him plenty of times this season and he’s always worked extremely hard , never been lower than a 7/10 . and it was his strength that won the ball off gareth macauley on the halfway line - then you can only admire his storming surge towards goal and the quality finish as he rifles the ball into the back of the net for the winner in injury time , embarrassing lescott again .
