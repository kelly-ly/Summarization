a black man has come out in support of police body cameras after he was gunned down by a white officer during a traffic stop and writhed in agony on the ground saying : ' why did you shoot me sir ? ' i am here to support and help other victims of police brutality because i am the survivor . ' dash cams ca n't record everything because sometimes things happens out of the view of the vehicle like in the case of walter scott . but once the officer exits that frame , it is no longer useful .
