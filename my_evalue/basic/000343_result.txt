( cnn ) c-span 's live telecast of the white house correspondents ' association dinner on saturday night , hosted by cecily strong of `` saturday night live , '' was not strong 's finest hour , though the entire affair seemed like five of c-span 's longest hours . but when you step back and look at the event as a whole , and appreciate what 's really happening -- in terms of press freedoms and even a u.s. president willing and able to poke fun at himself as well as others -- it 's hard not to think of this particular beltway-meets-showbiz event as a wonderfully american exercise in tolerance and good humor . president barack obama , as strong 's warm-up act , did n't hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. ( strong got her turn at 10:45 . )
