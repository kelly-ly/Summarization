anzac day is a time to come together as one to salute our diggers who sacrificed and fought in gallipoli , but it seems some have found another way to commemorate the special day . scroll down for video . one person wrote a meaningful caption about anzac day but uploaded a bared stomach ( left ) while a clothing store uploaded three women eating anzac cookies with hashtag # leastweforget . one woman said she had a father in the army but her picture illustrated something completely different ( left ) while two friends pulled funny and awkward looks inside a crowded bus as they headed to dawn service .
