curiosity rover has discovered strange , multi-coloured veins on mars that could give astronomers new insights into the red planet 's watery past . scientists believe the bizarre formed in mars ' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded bedrock . the dark material that lines the fracture walls reflects an earlier episode of fluid flow than the white , calcium-sulphate-rich veins do - although both flows occurred after the cracks formed . thanks to missions like nasa 's curiosity rover , we know mars once had water - but until now we did n't know how much .
