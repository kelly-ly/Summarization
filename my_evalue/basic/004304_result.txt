a federal judge has ordered the internal revenue service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status . the agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010 , when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like ' patriots ' or ' tea party ' in their names . lois lerner , the former irs official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal , ran the ' exempt organizations ' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits ; the justice department said this week that it wo n't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions .
