wildlife officials in alaska are going to kill a mother bear and her four cubs after the family started eating out from trash cans in a busy neighborhood . the black bears were spotted in the government hill area of anchorage several days in a row , nosing through overturned receptacles and putting the neighborhood on alert . officials with alaska 's department of fish and game ruled thursday that killing the family was the only option as once they develop a taste for trash they are likely to return even if moved . one is shown above outside a property .
