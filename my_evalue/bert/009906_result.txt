gary neville believes louis van gaal 's greatest achievement as a football manager is the making of jose mourinho . and neville believes mourinho may try to nulify the threat of the big belgian midfielder by selecting john obi mikel or kurt zouma in midfield . as a tactic , this would n't ordinarily worry the chelsea manager , but the idea of van gaal going to stamford bridge and not only winning , but also dominating the ball , would maybe open up the wounds of his early encounters with barcelona while coaching real madrid , when the barca purists outplayed and beat his team well .
