siobhan-marie o'connor won gold in the 200 metres individual medley at the british championships to ensure qualification for the world championships this summer . it 's just something we have to deal with . the commonwealth and european champion is still likely to race the 800m in russia , after finishing more than 10 seconds clear of jessica thielmann ( 8:32:19 ) in second and camilla hattersley in third ( 8:37:99 ) . ' for myself i would have liked to have gone quicker but to make the worlds qualifying time yesterday i 'm sure i 'll get to swim the event there . '
