the next time you take the kids on a pilgrimage to see the talking mouse or head down to south beach for some sun/sin , get a window seat and spend the moments before landing contemplating the seemingly endless swamp below . on approach into miami or orlando , it just looks like squishy wasteland full of things that want to hurt you : snakes and scorpions , rats and roaches , gators and mosquitoes . but what they did n't know is that without this swamp , there can be no `` good life '' in florida .
