standing in a public shower cubicle with my screaming 15-month-old son , i was starting to wonder whether i truly was a keycamp type of person . things have come on a long way since i was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south-west of france . lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip-up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm , but so does double-glazing , a fully-fitted kitchen and air conditioning . we quickly made use of the kids club , run by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic couriers .
