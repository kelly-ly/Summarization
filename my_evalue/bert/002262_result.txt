justin rose might just have made the most important pencil mark of his entire career to put himself in contention at augusta this weekend . i made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me , and after that i played with the same rhythm as the first day . ’ maybe ian poulter could borrow rose’s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter couldn’t get going .
