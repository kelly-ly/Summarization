a young english fan who wrote a letter to richie benaud asking for tips on spin bowling almost 20 years ago has shared the australian cricket great 's response in the wake of his death . your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left , ' benaud wrote . ' jonathon stevenson , who now works at livewire sport , was just 16 years old when he asked for benaud 's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on twitter as a tribute to the ' great man ' . the australian cricketer and commentator passed away in his sleep on thursday night in sydney after battling skin cancer .
