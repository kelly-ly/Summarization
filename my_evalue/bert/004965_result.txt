the british veterinary association has withdrawn its support for the shooting of free-running badgers in controversial pilot culls . the two four-year pilot culls in somerset and gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them , says the bva . it comes after the environment secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the tories win the election . in gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot , falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in tb in livestock , leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there .
