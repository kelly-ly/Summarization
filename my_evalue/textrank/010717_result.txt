a mother-of-two who posted pictures of her post-pregnancy stretchmarks on instagram to inspire others was horrified after they were removed for breaching the site 's decency guidelines . but i decided to post a picture of my belly on instagram because i 've had twins . ' i felt so confident posting the picture showing my baby belly , my belly that carried twin girls for only six months . ' instagram 's community guidelines state : ' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do n't allow nudity on instagram .
