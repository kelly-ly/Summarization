leicester boss nigel pearson would have had the ' outstanding ' esteban cambiasso down as his man of the match in saturday 's 2-1 win over west ham even if the veteran foxes midfielder had not scored his fine goal . cambiasso netted with a sweet strike in the 12th minute to put his side 1-0 up at the king power stadium , hitting the ball first time from just outside the box after it had sat up for him from a ricochet . and pearson added : ' success is relative and success in the past for him , with the clubs he has played for , was winning titles and cups , and success for him at leicester this year will be to be a player who has been instrumental in us avoiding relegation . ' hopefully he will be a success at that as well . '
