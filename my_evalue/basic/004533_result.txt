now zara tindall , 33 , has turned her hand to barrel-pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband mike along while striking a pose for the cameras . the moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer rob edmond 's marathon barrel-roll from perthshire to wiltshire . edmond , who set off nine days and 517 miles ago , rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day , only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way .
