mothers and fathers should use the ‘ carrot and the stick’ approach to make children do the things they find boring or difficult – from going to the dentist to doing their homework , sir james munby said . ‘ there are many things which they ought to do that children may not want to do or even refuse to do : going to the dentist , going to visit some “boring” elderly relative , going to school , doing homework or sitting an examination , the list is endless . ‘ why should we expect any less of a parent whose rebellious teenage child is refusing to see her father ? ’ confiscating mobile phones or gadgets from teenagers is a suitable way for parents to get their way , said judge sir james munby .
