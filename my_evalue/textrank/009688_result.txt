the researchers picked out 100,000 galaxies of interest , and found that 50 of them were emitting ‘ unusually high levels of mid-infrared radiation . ’ this telescope is perfect for detecting mid-infrared radiation that an advanced alien race might be emitting . however , it’s possible that some galaxies do harbour advanced alien life - but they are emitting less energy than we can currently detect .
