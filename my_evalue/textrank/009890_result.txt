mark wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for england . england may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in antigua next week to play the first of three tests . the only place in england’s first test team yet to be decided , it seems , is between adil rashid and james tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and tredwell was the clear winner here , taking three wickets to rashid’s one .
