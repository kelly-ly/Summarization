the oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties . the distinct tracks found at ileret in kenya ( like the one above ) are the oldest human footprints in the world . the researchers , who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the paleoanthropology society in san francisco , hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in africa . previous work by dr roach has also shown that homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter .
