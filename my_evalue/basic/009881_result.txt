sarah foot says her affair with open water began on hampstead heath after a local swimming pool closed down , and has taken her to swimming in the north sea off the coast of suffolk ( pictured ) . i’m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek , racing crawl - i’m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke . so best of all has to be swimming outdoors , and here on the east coast in suffolk it is now warm enough — just about — for the sea .
