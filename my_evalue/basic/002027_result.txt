team sky 's geraint thomas had to settle for 14th place in an incident-packed tour of flanders as norwegian alexander kristoff took victory in a sprint finish with holland 's niki terpstra . with tom boonen and fabian cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury , thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in e3 harelbeke and third-place finish at the gent-wevelgem sprint classic . he was in contention for much of sunday 's race as team sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods , but the welshman was unable to recover ground as kristoff ( team katusha ) and terpstra ( etixx - quick-step ) launched a late breakaway .
