the end-of-season awards will go to the best attacker but if there was a defender of the year , john terry would clean up . this has been his best season in a chelsea shirt . but it’s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year . the way newcastle are going i would not be surprised if they don’t get a single point between now and the end of the season .
