abase hussen – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join is earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘maybe’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group al-muhajiroun . mr hussen told mps last month , after his daughter amira abase fled to syria aged 15 , that he could think of ‘nothing’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join is , as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism . yesterday mr hussen , who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife fetia , conceded they might have influenced the youngster , who would have been 13 at the time .
