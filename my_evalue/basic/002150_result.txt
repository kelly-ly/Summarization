genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred . the last of the woolly mammoths ( shown in the reconstruction above ) were isolated on an arctic island for around 5,000 years , forcing them to inbreed as their population dwindled until disappering 4,500 years ago . they have published full dna sequences of one mammoth found in oimyakon , northeast siberia – thought to be around 45,000 years old – and another from one of the last surviving mammoths found on wrangel island , north of russia in the arctic ocean .
