eight sides still have a chance of claiming one of the two automatic promotion places , even with just five games left to play of the regular season . here are eight players - one each from bournemouth , norwich , watford , middlesbrough , derby , wolves , brentford and ipswich - that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not . this side would surely stay up in the premier league with ease ... composite xi ( 4-2-3-1 ) : john ruddy ( norwich ) ; dominic iorfa ( wolves ) , russell martin ( norwich ) , steve cook ( bournemouth ) , tyrone mings ( ipswich ) ; will hughes ( derby ) , bradley johnson ( norwich ) ; matt ritchie ( bournemouth ) , alex pritchard ( brentford ) , bakary sako ( wolves ) ; troy deeney ( watford ) .
