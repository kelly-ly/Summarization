ronnie o'sullivan has thrown his name into the mix to replace jeremy clarkson as host of top gear . whether i could co-pilot with someone else , i 'd definitely be up for it . i do n't know if i 'd want to follow in jeremy 's footsteps - i 'll let someone else do that and get the sack and then i 'll take it after them . o'sullivan is searching for his sixth world title this year at the crucible and beat craig steadman 10-3 in the first round .
