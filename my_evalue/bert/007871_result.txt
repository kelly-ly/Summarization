a british policeman has been left paralysed from the waist down after breaking his neck while on holiday with his family . luke is outgoing and fun to be around and makes me smile every day , even now in our darkest moment together . ' there is a significant language barrier so it 's quite an isolating experience but luke is very fit , he 's a very fit young man and he and i go to the gym together . ' this guy is a gentleman and an example to us all . '
