the # grannyhair trend may still be going strong for women the world over , but it seems men will always hold the crown for rocking the grey look - as david beckham proved earlier this week . no doubt the 42-year-old has been getting greying tips from his friend and fellow silver fox , george clooney . and with those looks and mop of dark grey hair , we can see why ... liam neeson 's grey sets off his coppery mop , while dermot mulroney oozes silvery sophistication . colin farrell is not yet in the forties club ( he 's 38 ) , but hollywood 's irish bad boy has the ' take me as i am ' attitude , and his refusal to dye his grey streaks is testament to that .
