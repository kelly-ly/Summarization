in 2011 the unmanned dawn spacecraft became humanity’s first ever emissary to the huge asteroid vesta , which resides in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter . using the map you can see a huge amount of features on vesta , from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to ‘3d mode’ also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft . you can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels , place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time , or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3d printer .
