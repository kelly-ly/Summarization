it was set as a maths problem , aimed at testing the logical reasoning skills of 14-year-olds in singapore . albert : i don’t know when cheryl’s birthday is , but i know that bernard does not know too . so , firstly , for albert to be ' certain ' that bernard can not know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday is not in may or june . if albert had been given may or june as the month , there is no way he could be certain that bernard does n't know the birthday .
