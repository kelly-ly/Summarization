yet all the smiles can not hide the reality that mccluskey and his union are a potent , sinister force in british politics , seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the labour movement to drag britain back to the dark days of the 1970s . labour 's umbilical link to mccluskey 's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing , anti-austerity snp , yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country . not only is unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the labour party 's structure , mps and finances , but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past , including a major expansion in the public sector , less flexibility in the workplace , higher taxation and ever more state spending .
