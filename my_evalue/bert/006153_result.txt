stoke midfielder charlie adam was left with mixed emotions after scoring the best goal of his career only to end up a loser at stamford bridge . stoke ended up losing 2-1 at stamford bridge as loic remy ( left ) scored the winner for chelsea . it 's three on the bounce we 've lost now , which is bad , but hopefully we can improve on that next week against west ham . ' adam added : ' it 's going to be a tough game .
