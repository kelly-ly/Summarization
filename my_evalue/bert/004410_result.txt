a schoolgirl was left stranded at a busy airport after easyjet refused to let her board its plane - because she was carrying two pieces of hand luggage . she even offered to leave the bag at the airport as she begged to board the 7am flight to bilbao . i just wanted to get home , but they didnâ€™t care .
