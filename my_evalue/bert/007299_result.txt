michael bloomberg wants to be mayor again - but in london rather than new york city , according to reports . his ex-wife is a british citizen , as are his two daughters . despite his repeated electoral success , mr bloomberg has faced opposition from the left over his close links to wall street , while the right has reacted with anger against his campaign to impose new restrictions on gun ownership across the us . bloomberg and johnson have met before - and at one meeting in 2013 , johnson even joked about doing a ' job swap ' with bloomberg - though there is no suggestion johnson has set his sights on new york city .
