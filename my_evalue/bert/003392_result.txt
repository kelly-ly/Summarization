this is the shocking moment a labour candidate collapsed seconds before he was due to take part in a live tv debate . the labour candidate started swaying on his feet in front of worried audience members before collapsing in front of presenter ellie pitt and his opponents on made in bristol 's programme , decision made . audience members rushed to help the labour candidate after he fell at their feet just seconds before going on air . i 'm just disappointed that voters in bristol did n't get the labour representation they deserved but i look forward to the opportunity of representing them in parliament as the next labour mp for bristol north west in a few weeks time ( fingers crossed ) .
