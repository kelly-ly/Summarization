fox sports australia will not take action against a freelance presenter who posted an instagram picture of herself and a friend in blackface make-up . a fox sports spokeswoman told aap that they had only become aware of briony ingerson 's photograph on monday and the company know it was unacceptable . john patten was another member of the public who felt strongly about the presenter 's ' ignorant ' actions . foxsportsaus - sack the girl and set an example will you ! @
