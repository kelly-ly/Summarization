at normal viewing distance , healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on einstein 's face , causing the brain to disregard marilyn monroe 's image altogether . the image was created by superimposing a blurry picture of monroe over a picture of albert einstein drawn in fine lines . features with a high spatial frequency ( einstein ) are only visible when you 're viewing them close up , and those with low spatial frequencies ( monroe ) are only visible from further away .
