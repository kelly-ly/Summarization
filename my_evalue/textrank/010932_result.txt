the sec said allen and daub paid about $ 20 million to investors but received only around $ 13 million in loan repayments from athletes . the sec 's criminal complaint quoted the website for capital financial as saying ' in many cases , athletes ' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car , pay the bills , or meet a financial demand . ' by pooling the resources of a network of investors , cfp gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid , short-term returns on investment . ' paul levenson , director of the sec 's regional office in boston , said in a statement : ' the defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes , but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went . ' as in any ponzi scheme , the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies . '
