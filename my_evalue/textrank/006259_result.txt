the row started after a group of far-right supporters calling themselves the east kent english patriots supported mr farage at an event in broadstairs on friday evening . when mr farage realised that mr field and his supporters had been seen by this newspaper on friday evening , he moved quickly to disown them , saying : ‘ members of an extremist group today arrived at a ukip public meeting at the same time as a mail on sunday camera arrives . ’ mr farage’s comments triggered a war of words with the patriots group , which immediately posted a message saying : ‘ we went to ukip meeting with members of kent nf and after the meeting nigel farage went on twitter saying we have far right extremists here ... the question is nig , do you want our vote or not ? ’ an anti-ukip campaigner , bunny la roche , claims she was followed into a cafe by mr field earlier this month after she turned up to protest at a ukip rally in margate on april 11 . mr field is a former regional organiser of the edl and was waiting for ukip leader nigel farage , pictured .
