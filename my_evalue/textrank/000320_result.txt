( cnn ) a grand jury in dallas county , texas , has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of jason harrison , a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital . an officer asks who she 's talking about , and she replies , `` my son , bipolar , schizo , '' as jason harrison appears in the doorway behind her . one of the two officers called to the scene tells harrison to drop the tool , a command the officers repeat at least four times as harrison 's mom screams , `` jay ! jay ! jay ! '' within five seconds of that first command , the 39-year-old schizophrenic man is shot five times -- including twice in the back as he crashes headlong into the home 's garage door , just a few feet from his mother .
