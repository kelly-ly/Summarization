in the video mr garginian says : ' hi guys , i want to tell you what , this is the real barbecue ok ? ' not your barbecue with the sausage , it 's all oily thing you eating , this is the real barbecue which is called armenian barbecue . ' all the uncles will gather around early and stand around the barbecue and drink vodka , ' ms garginian said . ' whenever my dad and uncles have been out at parks doing armenian barbecue they always receive attention from the public , and they always let people come over and try some to share our culture . ' i like sausages on the barbecue , i like a sausage sizzle , but it 's so different to the type of barbecue we do . '
