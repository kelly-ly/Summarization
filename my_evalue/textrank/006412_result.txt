rubbish teams refused to empty a recycling bin because it had an empty crisp packet on its lid . i live opposite a shop and some kind person , not wanting to litter the area , put their crisp packet in the top of my recycling bin , and for that i have to be penalised . ' a council spokesman said ' to prevent a whole truck of materials ending up in landfill , undoing the good work of a majority of residents who are recycling correctly , the council enforces the non-collection of contaminated recycling bins . ' all collectors working for waverley 's contractor have stickers to place on bins which detail why it has not been collected and remind residents what should and should not be in the blue bin . '
