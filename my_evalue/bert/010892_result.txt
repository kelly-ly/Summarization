picture the scene . next make me beautiful . but i wish they wouldn’t package stuff together , like the face primer and face illuminator ( £20 for both ) — the former has too much silicone and feels greasy , while the latter has a subtle glow to wear alone or under foundation . it comes in innovative , twist-up packaging , like a lipstick .
