francis coquelin is determined to take his chance at arsenal and claims he wants to follow in the footsteps of club legend patrick vieira . 'i’m not going to say to you i am ( the new vieira ) , obviously i want to be but i think it’s down to the performance i put in every week so i’m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully i can do that in the long term , ' coquelin told bt sport . i could see the injuries over there , i think arteta was out , ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and i extended it and thought maybe i won’t get the chance now , ' added coquelin .
