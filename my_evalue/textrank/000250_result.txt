there 's so much wrong with boxing 's business model , but all you really need to understand is this : most sports fans probably ca n't name a single active boxer after mayweather and pacquiao . while it may seem like a stretch , i think we are drawn to prizefights less to revel in what 's dark and nasty in human nature than to honor what 's good and noble . a fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display : the bared fangs , the blood , the frenetic drive to do harm .
