out of every £100 spent by these western nations on overseas aid , no less than £14 now comes from the uk . people are telling me on the doorstep during this campaign that we should cut the amount we spend on overseas aid , and increase opportunities for poorer countries to trade with the eu – trade , not aid , is what we need . the oecd report , 2014 global outlook on aid , shows that britain is one of only five members of the dac to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid along with sweden , luxembourg , norway and denmark .
