congratulations to australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas . stuart lancaster must be free to pick his best players , no matter where in the world they ply their trade . matt giteau and drew mitchell , for example , are top-class performers for toulon and if england lose to australia with those two playing out of their skins , you know exactly what the headlines will be .
