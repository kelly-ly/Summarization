( cnn ) supported by american intelligence and supplied with advanced u.s.-made weaponry , saudi jets began airstrikes in yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom 's washington ambassador described as `` restoring the legitimate government '' and protecting a `` yemeni constitution and elections .
