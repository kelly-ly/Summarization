gareth bale pulled up with a calf strain after just two minutes of real madrid’s league game on saturday and will almost certainly miss the second leg of the champions league against atletico madrid on wednesday . one year and two days , after one of his greatest moments at real madrid when he ran half the length of the pitch to score the winner in the copa del rey final , bale broke down with a muscle pull against malaga . he will have further tests on the left calf muscle in the next 24 hours but the concern shown when he went down at the start of real’s crucial league game suggested his chances of recovering inside three days are non-existent and that he could also face a race to be fit for the champions league semi-final on may 5-6 . gareth bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the bernabeu on saturday evening .
