notts county have appointed ricardo moniz as their new manager just a week after the club announced that he was unable to commit to the role . notts county have been without a permanent manager since the departure of shaun derry on march 23 , with paul hart and mick halsall taking caretaker charge of their recent games . but moniz , who steered red bull salzburg to austrian league and cup glory in the 2011/12 campaign , will now take the reins . ricardo has a fantastic reputation within the game , not only for the style of football that he plays , but also his ability to spot and nurture young talent , so i am confident that his appointment will be of benefit to all levels of the club .
