a gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers Â£200,000 . the travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation ' and after council offices had closed for the weekend . fylde council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site . but a travellers group representative elizabeth collins then appealed and took the matter to the high court in september 2012 .
