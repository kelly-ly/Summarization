mr miliband 's remarks came amid growing alarm over the number of desperate families risking their lives to escape the raging civil wars in the middle east and north africa . around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach europe in boats launched from libya . and i think if we can do [ tackle ] that and provide more aid and assistance in north africa to encourage people to stay put rather than risk life and limb moving great distances , that it seems to me is a more sustainable solution than coming up with lots of arbitrary numbers about who takes in which number of migrants from north africa .
