many beetles secrete foul-smelling or bad-tasting chemicals from their abdomens to ward off predators , but bombardier beetles take it a step further . researchers at cornell university snapped another type of bombardier beetle , stenaptinus insignis ' attack in 1999 , to reveal they use the explosive defensive mechanism to buy time when they are under attack . they predicted that this thin cuticle would be displaced by the force of the reactions in such a way that it would impinge upon the valve - temporarily shutting off the flow of reactants . to investigate this hypothesis , the team directly observed the internal dynamics of spray pulsation in live brachinus elongatulus beetles , a type of bombardier beetle , which is found throughout southern arizona . of 500 beetles , the researchers were able to record 30 discharges from 14 individuals .
