a toddler was killed after being swept away in a drainage ditch tuesday afternoon . as soon as i pulled him out , his pour little belly looked like it was full of water , and kind of knew when i pulled him out that he was gone , ' said drake dufrene ( above ) the boy 's father . ' the family now says they are taking comfort knowing that their boy is in a better place , but are still in shock . ' it 's just , it 's tragic .
