tony blair was branded ' out of touch ' last night after claiming that he is ' absolutely not ' in ' the league of the super-rich ' . yeah , i 'm very lucky . if it 's the right thing i 'm doing , then i should be doing it even if i am being attacked for it . ' mr blair and his wife bought this grade i listed mansion south pavilion in wooton underwood in buckinghamshire , once owned by sir john gielgud which has ncreased in value to almost Â£8 million .
