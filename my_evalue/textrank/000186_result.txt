( cnn ) president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president . reaching a good , solid agreement with iran is a worthy , desirable goal . saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among iran 's muslim rivals will do the same . again , a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development .
