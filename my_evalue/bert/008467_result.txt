it marks the moment when the civilised world entered the dark ages and some of the most spectacular societies in the world disappeared . as each of these great societies were interconnected , the collapse of one also affected the others , creating a domino-like effect , claims professor eric cline , director of the capitol archaeological institute at george washington university . clay tables found in afek in israel , huttusa in turkey and emar in mesopotamia and ugarit in syria also suggest the area was hit by an unrelenting drought . indeed professor cline warns that he can see parallels between the events that led to the downfall of those ancient societies and those occurring today .
