with six games to go - five for qpr and seven for leicester - there are just four points separating the bottom five sides in the premier league . if not , sunderland will stay up by the skin of their teeth and the bottom three go down , which should act as a warning to bournemouth , norwich , watford , middlesbrough and the rest involved in the wacky races at the top of the championship . hull ( away ) - may 9 . burnley ( away ) - april 25 .
