dr jonathan hendricks , a paleontologist at the san jose state university who led the research , said that the lack of colouration in many fosisilised cone snail shells made them difficult to identify . he said : ' original coloration patterns — if not the actual colors themselves —sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light , which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce . ' once a specimen has been photographed under uv light , it is possible to use photoediting software to reconstruct the original shell coloration pattern . ' dr hendricks said : ' this approach — combined with the exceptional neogene fossil record of the dominican republic , as well as other regional fossil deposits — has the potential to provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic development of the modern western atlantic cone snail fauna . ' clearly much more work needs to be done to better understand the compounds responsible for shell coloration . ' that said , it seems that oxidation - caused either naturally by exposure of shells to sunlight over prolonged periods of time , or artificially by soaking in bleach for several days - plays a role in causing formerly pigmented regions of fossil shells to fluoresce under uv light , though the reason is not currently understood .
