president barack obama and cuban president raul castro shook hands last night ahead of a historic meeting which may see cuba declassified as a state sponsor of terrorism . obama , who met with activists from across latin america , including two cuban dissidents , appears to be close to removing communist-run cuba from a u.s. list of countries that it says sponsor terrorism . while obama 's policy has been widely praised around latin america , this was tempered last month when his administration imposed sanctions on venezuela , cuba 's closest ally and main benefactor .
