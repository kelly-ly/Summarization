bob mcdonnell made his final written plea to a federal appeals court wednesday , arguing that the favors he did for a wealthy businessman were routine courtesies and not part of a bribery scheme . mcdonnell and his wife , maureen , were convicted in a joint trial in september of accepting more than $ 165,000 in gifts and loans from former star scientific inc. ceo jonnie williams in exchange for promoting his company 's nutritional supplements . prosecutors had written in a 93-page submission to the court that mcdonnell 's actions fit the definition of ' official acts ' even better than those taken by former louisiana rep. william jefferson , who is serving 13 years in prison for taking bribes in exchange for using his influence to broker business deals with government leaders in africa .
