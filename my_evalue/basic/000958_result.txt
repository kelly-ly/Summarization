last thursday , jeff courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws , metal pieces , three watch heads and some chewed leather straps . `` my husband , who 's the most calm person that i know , called me up and said , ' i 'm not quite sure if i should panic , ' `` said courcelle 's wife , michele parkinson . the veterinarian removed `` about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus '' during the endoscopy , and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces , mspca spokesman rob halpin said .
