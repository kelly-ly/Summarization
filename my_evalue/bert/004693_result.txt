former super middleweight champion nigel benn is back in the ring and the 51-year-old , dubbed the ‘ dark destroyer’ , has certainly still got what it takes . barkley had been in the ring with the likes of roberto duran and thomas hearns , but there was more to come from benn as he returned to britain to fight chris eubank . benn crouches low as he looks to avoid the powerful punch of eubank during their bout in birmingham . he recaptured the wbc middleweight title against mauro galvano and defended the belt three times before he was able to face eubank in the ring again .
