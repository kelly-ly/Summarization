i’ve had close-up experience with three of the world’s five surviving species of rhino : the white rhino looks like the main battle tank of an extra-terrestrial army , while the black is more like a hot-rod armoured car . yes , give them a fair crack of the whip and they’d be as successful as any of the big creatures we have left on our planet , for in many countries the wild places they depend on are still in fine shape and perfectly capable of supporting any number of rhinos . threatened : sudan is the target of poachers looking to sell rhino horn which can make up to £47,000 a kilo .
