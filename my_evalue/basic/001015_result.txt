thousands of yazidis now call this corner of iraqi kurdistan home , about 18 miles ( 30 kilometers ) from one of the front lines with isis , where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes . mahmoud was out running errands when isis fighters arrived , taking his wife , ahlam , their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents . ahlam tells us that about a week before we met , isis fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house .
