pence is making the right call . promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one . shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves ; it simply sends the message that religion is important , and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why , people should be allowed to practice as they need . because indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief .
