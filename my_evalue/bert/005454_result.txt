injuries : the exploding phone caused injuries so deep that doctors could see hanghang 's jawbone . the boy , known only as hanghang , was using the old handset as an alarm when he woke up early for school and started to play with it . a short circuit is another possible cause but this is a less likely unless the phone has been illegally modified in some way . it affects lithium batteries more where the phone may be fully charged but is left on charging or if phone is used whilst charging may lead to lithium batteries overheating .
