ronny deila hailed ultimate impact sub leigh griffiths for his hat-trick performance in celtic’s comeback premiership win over kilmarnock . griffiths took just 19 minutes to score a treble that takes celtic ever closer to a clean sweep of domestic honours , staking an obvious claim to start in sunday’s scottish cup semi-final against inverness at hampden . you can be angry but the way to get back into the team is to prove you deserve to play - like leigh did today .
