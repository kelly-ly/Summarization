the appreciative majority overwhelmed the vocal minority to offer a tribute to the phantom of the emirates , one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an arsenal shirt in the modern era . itâ€™s true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for arsenal it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have . together with a philosophical tweak , it has made arsenal a more solid defensive unit , capable of taking points from manchester city and chelsea and winning at manchester united in the fa cup .
