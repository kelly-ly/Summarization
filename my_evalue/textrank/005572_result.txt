researchers found , almost by accident , that cosmic rays were a suitable probe to measure electric fields within thunderclouds . this new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity . this new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity .
