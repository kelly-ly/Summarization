scholes does however believe that his friend and former team-mate ryan giggs could lead manchester united into the latter stages of europe’s premier club competition if he is given the chance to succeed louis van gaal at old trafford further down the line . i hope that it will change in the future and i have high hopes that my friend ryan giggs will be handed the reins at manchester united at some point having served an apprenticeship under louis van gaal . ’ scholes believes outgoing borussia dortmund manager jurgen klopp would be a welcome addition to the premier league – but does not believe he will replace manuel pellegrini at manchester city . manchester city is the destination that has been mentioned more than once but all the information that comes back to me in manchester is that pep guardiola will take that job when his contract at bayern munich expires in one year’s time .
