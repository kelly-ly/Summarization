chemists have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - dna , proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light . they claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the late heavy bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide . this poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions , along with hydrogen sulphide , driven by ultraviolet light .
