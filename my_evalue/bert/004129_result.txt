recent weeks might have suggested an early summer , but britain is now in for a reality check as ice , rain and snow arrive with -5c ( 23f ) temperatures . the colder weather is set to last the first half of may - and the forecast comes less than a fortnight after the mercury breached the 25c ( 77f ) mark . warmer days : people enjoy the warm weather at jubilee gardens next to the london eye in the centre of the capital on saturday , april 18 . early forecasts for the bank holiday weekend suggest the north east will see the best weather into saturday - but could still be hit by showers .
