as the sun sets on the saharan desert , its colours cast a glow on its vast sand dunes causing rainbow light to dance across the landscape . but exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed . these are long rolls of air that spiral , or rotate one way before rotating another . the researchers continued that after the complex linear dunes develop , local wind patterns and the amount of sand suggest it is possible for them to maintain their linear shape , rather than evolving into star shapes for example , even as wind direction changes .
