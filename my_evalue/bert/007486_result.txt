a fiery stoush has erupted between the chief executive of rupert murdoch 's media empire in australia and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss . when mr clarke defended the newspaper as the ' finest national newspaper operating in australia ' , ms milne flatly told the inquiry , ' you and i wo n't agree on that ' . ' mr clarke also rejected allegations recently published by fairfax media alleging $ 4.5 billion had been siphoned from mr murdoch 's australian operations to the united states virtually tax free . committee chairman sam dastyari had written to mr jordan on tuesday requesting he reveal the names .
