( cnn ) a jury of rolling stone 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia , and the emerging consensus is that rolling stone 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism . but the story began to unravel almost immediately when washington post reporter t. rees shapiro took a closer look , leading rolling stone to back away from the story and request a review by the columbia university graduate school of journalism . and at every step of the way , when jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither erdely nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story .
