writing in the journal royal society open science , dr jill pruetz , a primatologist at iowa state university said : 'savannah-dwelling chimpanzees at fongoli , sénégal , are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools . ' acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at fongoli supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting . ' if tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics ( i.e . greater size , strength ) to achieve hunting efficiency , such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition . ' tool use by chimpanzees is now considered to be fairly widespread with many groups having been observed using stones or sticks to crack open nuts , fish for termites and in some cases to capture small mammals . ' with fishing , termites grab on to a twig and do n't let go and the chimp eats the termites off the twig . ' when hunting , the bush baby tries to bite , escape or hide from the chimp .
