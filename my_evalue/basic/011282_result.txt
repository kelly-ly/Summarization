jordan spieth believes he will be better equipped to cope with the pressure of trying to win the masters after coming close to creating history last year . spieth held a two-shot lead after seven holes of the final round 12 months ago as he looked to surpass the absent tiger woods as the youngest ever masters champion , as well as being the first player to win on their tournament debut since fuzzy zoeller in 1979 . that lead became a two-shot deficit as he bogeyed the eighth and ninth and bubba watson birdied the same holes , watson eventually going on to win his second green jacket in the space of three years .
