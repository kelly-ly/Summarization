visitors to a wildlife park in new zealand got to encounter a pride of lions up-close and personal . a number of lions are fed directly through the metal bars , while others receive meat dropped from the back of the cage . a keeper then drops meat from the back of it and the lions begin tailing off one by one with their own little piece of food .
