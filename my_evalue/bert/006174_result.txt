a clean-water advocate took an earth day swim in new york city 's polluted gowanus canal , a site designated by the federal government as especially polluted , but quit less than halfway through . the agency issued guidelines in 2011 saying that people should ' never swim in the canal ' , which runs over 1Â½ miles through a narrow industrial zone near increasingly wealthy neighborhoods in brooklyn . however swain , who has previously done long swims along the hudson river in new york and the columbia in washington , wanted to call attention to the slow clean up of the canal and urge for it to be accelerated . it is particularly filthy after rainstorms .
