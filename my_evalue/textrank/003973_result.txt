the sleep health foundation have released a study reporting that 30 percent of australians complain about their lack of sleep on a daily basis . according to chair professor david hillman , those misplaced hours of sleep must be paid back in order to be functional for the entire week . professor hillman added that our sleep pattern is influenced by how much we are willing to compromise from the work week . ' a lot of us pay back a bit of that debt on the weekend but i think it 's possible to exist in a sort of tolerable , sleep-restricted state , ' he said . ' in other words you 're not optimal , but you 're still functional . ' pushing these sleep-debt boundaries can lead to micro sleeps in certain people .
