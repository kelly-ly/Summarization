an armenian expat who shows australians how to cook a ' real barbecue ' has become an internet sensation after his daughter posted his hilarious video online . in the video mr garginian , who moved to australia from armenia in 1977 , dismisses the australian-style barbecue of cooking ' oily ' sausages . i think it 's just because it 's funny , the way my dad explains it is funny . ' i like sausages on the barbecue , i like a sausage sizzle , but it 's so different to the type of barbecue we do . '
