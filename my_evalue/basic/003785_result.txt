goals certainly make a difference and , in rudy gestede and jordan rhodes , blackburn have two players that millwall simply do not . gestede , scorer of a hat-trick against nottingham forest here on saturday , took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute , despatching a clinical right-foot shot into the top corner after craig conwayâ€™s cross found its way to him on the edge of the six-yard box . rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory , steering his shot past a stranded david forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser .
