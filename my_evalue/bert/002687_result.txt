in the heart of yellowstone national park , a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day . previous research found a relatively small magma chamber , known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir , directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles ( 10,420 cubic km ) . each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano . a 10-foot ( 3 metre ) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles ( 1,610km ) , leaving two-thirds of the us uninhabitable .
