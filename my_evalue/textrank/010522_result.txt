while some complain that this involves little more than standing bored in a doorway or handing over meals , others have used their unlimited access to these defenceless so-called ' enemies of the state ' to build a reputation for the kind of shocking cruelty and sadism isis commanders appreciate . it is widely-understood that britons travelling to iraq and syria to join islamist militant group isis are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder . useless in combat and a liability in situations when a simple mistakes can cost lives , the few westernisers who do make it on to the battlefield are used as little more than cannon fodder . leading the line when the odds are stacked against them , or acting as suicide bombers to clear the path for more experienced and important fighters , isis commanders convince the young men that their lives on earth are worthless and that to die for the terror group is somehow praiseworthy .
