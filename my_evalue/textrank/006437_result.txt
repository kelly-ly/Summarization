it was ten minutes short of 1am when javier hernandez left the santiago bernabeu last night . to pick up on that and not on the out-pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the mexican striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best â€“ score big goals in big games . he replaced the frenchman last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games .
