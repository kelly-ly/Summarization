he joined leicester last summer on a free transfer and signed a one-year deal at the king power stadium . ' when you start another season you have an objective , and this is the objective for us . ' for me , winning a cup or winning the league with another team is the same now as having the possibility to save leicester in the premier league . ' leicester , promoted last season , will have their work cut out to avoid an immediate return to the second tier . i understood when i signed for leicester it 's not an easy job to stay in the premier league , ' he said . i think some people think for leicester all is finished .
