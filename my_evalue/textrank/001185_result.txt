there isn’t as much excitement when it’s the second baby , but a girl would have the potential to boost the fashion industry . ' as well as the boost to baby clothing sales that we have seen from prince george , a princess would be able to set trends throughout her life , which will be great for the people who designed her clothes or those who can make quick knock-off copies . ' and dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog , what prince george wore , dedicated to all things baby style . but while the duchess of cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears , even she can not compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power . from £44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops , the royal baby effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and ebay entrepreneurs contemplating another year of buoyant sales to come .
