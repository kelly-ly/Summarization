conceding three goals would be embarrassment enough for any goalkeeper , but rob green was forced to suffer even more humiliation at the hands of a ball boy on monday night . as the clock ticked down during qpr 's 3-3 away draw with aston villa , a cheeky youngster decided to while away a few more seconds by mugging off the former england no 1 with a handmade nutmeg . the ball boy , who initially shames himself by slipping over while retrieving the ball , toys with green by pretending to hand him the ball back before rolling it between the clearly frustrated 35-year-old 's legs .
