having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin , jordan spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green . he wasn’t going to three-putt from there , so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the masters . to shoot 14 under , the lowest two-round score at augusta , and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship , isn’t boring .
