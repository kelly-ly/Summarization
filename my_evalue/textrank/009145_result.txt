among those who had three doses of rts , s and a booster shot , the number of clinical cases of malaria – those confirmed by a doctor – was reduced by 36 per cent after four years . in the trials , an average of 1,363 cases of clinical malaria were prevented over four years for every 1,000 children vaccinated , and 1,774 cases in those who also received a booster . the disease is difficult to treat because the malaria parasite has a complicated life cycle and has learned how to evade the human immune system over hundreds of years .
