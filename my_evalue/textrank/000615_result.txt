jostling crowds of nepalis and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths ' height above street level allowed excellent views of major hindu processions and other events . fortunately others appear to still be standing , including the sundari chowk temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures : the gray stone , mogul-influenced krishna mandir ; the 17th-century bishwa nath mandir with its large stone elephants at the entrance ; and the nearby smaller 17th-century bimsen mandi `` god of the traders '' pagoda . the town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area , which displayed refined temples , pagodas , shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda , allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals .
