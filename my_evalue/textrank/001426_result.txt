benedict cumberbatch , who played turing in the oscar-nominated the imitation game , said : ' alan turing was a war hero , who broke the enigma code helping to bring an end to world war ii , the father of modern computing science , and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result . ' at the beginning of his journal , gandy writes : ' it seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of alan 's on notation , but possibly a little sinister ; a dead father figure , some of whose thoughts i most completely inherited . ' prior to the sale , andrew hodges , a leading turing scholar , said : ' alan turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value . ' the notes , which are highly personal , show turing working through different equations and considering different results .
