we spent £400 on a 1940s loo - it took us four months to find one ! my biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage i had six . i do have modern things mixed in , but only when they have a retro 50s look , for example our microwave . after digging around in my mum’s record collection i realised i loved sixties music , particularly the beatles and rolling stones , and devoured books about the decade .
