it was once a colourful backdrop for the shenanigans of steve martin and eddie murphy , but years of neglect meant this piece of film history risked being lost forever . the petrol station was also where reggie hammond ( eddie murphy ) informed jack cates ( nick nolte ) of the location of the stolen money in the 1982 comedy 48 hours . the new store , which has a drive through , serving hatch and outdoor seating area , retains the main existing structure as well as the canopy from an added car wash . starbucks did not try to over-brand the building but tried to keep it true to the original with limited signage .
