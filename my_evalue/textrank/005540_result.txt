mr clegg 's remarks come after mr farage held out an olive branch to the prime minister last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible labour government . and in the strongest hint yet that they could work together , mr farage dropped his demand that the tories ditch mr cameron before any post election deal . asked if he and mr cameron could ' lock out ' mr miliband and mr salmond from downing street , he replied : ' well if that were possible then we would try and do that . ' mr farage previously said that mr cameron would need to step down as tory leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal .
