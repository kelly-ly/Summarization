( cnn ) in this holy week , let us be reminded of what the word of god says about fair and living wages . one dollar above the minimum wage is n't enough to make paying for groceries , rent and transportation much easier , especially coming from a company that makes nearly $ 5 billion a year in profits . it 's not enough , as people of my faith say , for those cooks and cashiers to afford their daily bread . we are at a turning point in american history .
