this is the moment that two total strangers who could pass for identical twins came face to face for the first time . i can’t remember the number of times i said “ this is so freaky” . but then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me . she added , ' some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , `` oh my god that’s my face '' ' while miss geaney appears to have beaten her fellow twin strangers participants , 21-year-old harry and 22-year-old terence , hands down , the search is n't over until april 27 .
