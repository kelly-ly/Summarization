a stunning fireball that crackled across the sky near the russian-finnish border last year shared its orbit with a huge asteroid found in october . this is according to a new study which claims the kola fireball had a ' disturbingly similar ' path to asteroid 2014 ur116 , which is due to pass by the moon in 2017 . the computer model compared the orbit of annama ( pictured ) , a 1,100lb ( 500kg ) rock , with the evolution of a dozen orbits of near-earth asteroids . while the study does not claim that asteroid 2014 ur116 sent the annama meteorite directly at earth , it suggests the two bodies are related .
