indeed , one children 's clothing company that became known around the world when prince george was photographed wearing their garments has released a very regal new range - fit for a prince ... or a princess . and dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog , what prince george wore , dedicated to all things baby style . but while the duchess of cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears , even she can not compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power . from Â£44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops , the royal baby effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and ebay entrepreneurs contemplating another year of buoyant sales to come .
