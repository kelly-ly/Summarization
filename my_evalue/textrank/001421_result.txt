james weld stumped up £15,000 to bring an end to a three year stand-off with natural england over who was responsible for the coastal path down to the beach at durdle door on dorset 's jurassic coast . james weld has stumped up £15,000 to end a three-year stand-off with natural england over access to durdle door beach . ' we have a very good relationship with natural england in all other areas but with coastal access they have ignored all the advice right from the beginning about managing honeypot sites . ' the whole thing has been laughable and ludicrous and i 've lost patience with it . ' in the end , regardless of who was officially responsible or the cost , we felt the need to step in to put durdle door back on the map for walkers and sightseers , and to help minimise the environmental impact to this extraordinary coastal feature . ' durdle door is a national icon as well as one of dorset 's icons so we 're delighted to be able to reopen it , but it 's sad it 's taken so long . '
