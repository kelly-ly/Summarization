louis van gaal believes manchester united will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the barclays premier league next season after persuading the old trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of america in july . after last summerâ€™s mammoth trek across the united states , an angry united manager van gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started . having to then play the final in florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw . van gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in pasadena and ann arbor last year .
