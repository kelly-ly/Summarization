the minister for communications malcolm turnbull is set to feature on the front cover of gq australia in a bold move that will no doubt set senators ' tongues wagging . if people find me persuasive or offensive that 's up to them , but i am comfortable in my own skin and i honestly never ask , `` how can i change myself to be more appealing to people ? '' . ' in a déjà vu inducing photo shoot and interview published by gq in march of 2013 , the then shadow minister opened up about his rise to politics and the business moves that made him a millionaire . but mr turnbull certainly sung a different tune when he was questioned about challenging tony abbott 's leadership and trying for the top job himself when questioned two years ago .
