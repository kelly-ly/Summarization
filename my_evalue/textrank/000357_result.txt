skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either . this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court is n't about catching criminals -- it 's bill collection , only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons , and acting under color of law . still , given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws , there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement .
