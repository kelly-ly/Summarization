top marks for saskia , the girlfriend of an arsenal fan who aced a written exam on all things gunners to save their relationship and whose mostly correct responses have gone viral . saskia , 17 , whose username is @ saskiaisabxlla , posted excerpts of the exam on monday with the message ‘ boyfriend made me take an @ arsenal exam . ’ a derogatory comment about hazard , the newly crowned pfa player of the year , got extra marks . saskia’s recall of last year’s fa cup final was also tested , but she mustn’t have been paying attention that day when the gunners beat hull 3-2 ( not 2-0 ) and aaron ramsey scored the winner ( not olivier giroud ) .
