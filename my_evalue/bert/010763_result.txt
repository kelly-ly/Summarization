visitors to a wildlife park in new zealand got to encounter a pride of lions up-close and personal . a lion stands next to one of the keepers and its large paw is the same size as the lady 's head . still frames capture a lion standing up against the side of the cage alongside the keeper â€“ its power and size is plain to see . a lion scales the cage and looks down at the people below as if deciding which one it would like to eat .
