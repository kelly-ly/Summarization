( cnn ) bernie sanders , my vermont senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president . he has also been a strong supporter of vermont 's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left , who wonder why the nra does n't attack him . and this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads , serve meals , deliver the mail , drive trucks and teach in schools . and if he won it , could he defeat a republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal ?
