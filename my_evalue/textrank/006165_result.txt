stokes ( left ) clashed with marlon samuels during the second test between west indies and england . england must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . there is an argument here to play the second spinner in adil rashid and if england went down that route in bridgetown the place of stokes or chris jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible .
