nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light-years away , making it one of the most distant planets ever found . this happens when one star happens to pass in front of another , and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star 's light . astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy , where star crossings are more common .
