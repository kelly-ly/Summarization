it probably wo n't be enough to surpass bill buckner in boston sports lore , but it 's close . a wicked mistake in the men 's college hockey title game on saturday by boston university 's goalie allowed providence to tie in the third period and paved the way for the friars to win their first title . the terriers came into saturday night with a 42-22-0 record at the td garden since it opened in 1995 . it was the providence 's first ncaa hockey title and third straight year a first-time champion has won it all .
