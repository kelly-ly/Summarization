soaring immigration means most parts of the country could have fewer available primary school places than pupils in just two years . labour’s education spokesman tristram hunt said : ‘ david cameron’s crisis in school places is yet more evidence the tory plan is failing children and working families . ‘ make no mistake , his decision to plough hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money on free schools into areas where there are no shortages of school places comes at the expense of the families in the areas where there is a desperate need . ’ according to the lga , no areas currently have more pupils than places , as councils in oversubscribed parts of the country have managed to create enough slots . of the more than half of areas expected to have more pupils than places by 2017/18 , the worst hit will be in london and the south east .
