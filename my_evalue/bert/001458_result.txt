disgruntled : marc macrae , who was election agent for the snp’s westminster leader angus robertson , said the party showed compassion for the lockerbie bomber but ostracised him . in january 2013 , mr macrae went to the doctor after experiencing prostate problems and was given tamsulosin , which is prescribed for an enlarged prostate , while tests were carried out . it feels very much like they’ve been ordered not to speak to me . ‘ comparison : like abdelbaset ali mohmed al megrahi – the lockerbie bomber , left and right - mr macrae was diagnosed with prostate cancer - but mr macrae said the terrorist treated better than him by the party .
