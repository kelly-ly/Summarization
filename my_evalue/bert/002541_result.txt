women are undervaluing themselves and asking for less pay than they should – widening the gender pay gap , it is claimed . on average , women ask for almost a fifth less than men , rising to nearly a third less in some financial sectors . the gender gap narrowed in the manufacturing industry and the legal sector to just 9 per cent . and in the it and security industry , women actually asked for higher pay , albeit just 2 per cent more – reversing the trend .
