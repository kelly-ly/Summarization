( cnn ) if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration 's clean power plan is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy . a group of university of tennessee graduate students made this point to epa at a public hearing last summer . at a recent hearing in the environment and public works committee , mary nichols , chairman of the california air resources board , told congress that epa looked at california 's california global warming solutions act when developing its so-called clean power plan and that epa 's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free . the administration also believes in man-driven global warming , which should make nuclear energy its golden key .
