president barack obama secretly granted the cia an exemption relaxing restrictions on drone strikes in pakistan after enacting more stringent rules in 2013 to reduce the risk of civilian casualties , it was revealed today . according to the wall street journal , which first reported the story monday citing current and former government officials , obama gave the spy agency a pass on providing proof that intended targets of drone strikes posed an imminent threat to the us . without obama 's waiver , cia operatives would have been forced to gather additional information and surveillance data on the al qaeda-linked militants targeted in the january 15 strike , which may have delayed it , possibly sparing the lives of dr warren weinstein , a 73-year-old economic adviser from the us , and 39-year-old italian aid worker giovanni lo porto . dr weinstein , pictured with his wife , was abducted after gunmen tricked their way into his home in lahore on august 13 , 2011 shortly before he was due to return home after seven years working in pakistan .
