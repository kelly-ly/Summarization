when two complete strangers living just an hour apart in ireland discovered they looked so alike they could be identical twins this week , the world was shocked . i was ridiculously nervous about how i would react to meeting someone who looks like me ' miss geaney ( right ) said about miss branigan ( left ) . but then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me . miss branigan ( right ) turned out to be a fellow ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from miss geaney ( left ) , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together .
