glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend richie benaud , after his death at 84 from skin cancer . fortunately , he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success , particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of tower of babel verbiage . o’sullevan , voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race , was circumspect about collateral chatter , just as longhurst and ‘ oh i say’ maskell knew the value of golden silence . very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator .
