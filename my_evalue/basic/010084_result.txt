corey has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at bristol children 's hospital since january and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer , mr and mrs edwards decided to get married . they had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters , two-year-old isabelle and six-month-old caitlyn , and corey 's ill health . when they learnt of their son 's wish , they felt there was no time like the present and , with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital , they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours .
