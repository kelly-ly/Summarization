amir khan believes kell brook has called him out so that he can have the ' one big payday ' which has so far eluded him during his 10-and-a-half year career . brook , who defeated jo jo dan to retain his ibf welterweight title last month , immediately challenged khan in a post-fight interview but the bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on may 30 , with his opponent yet to be confirmed . if he keeps going on like this , that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day , he 's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that i ca n't fight then because of ramadan .
