a telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by nhs doctors , cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes . when tumours in the lungs are suspected , patients can face a raft of tests and even surgery to find out if they have the disease , often resulting in an agonising wait before they start lifesaving treatment . now doctors at university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust ( uclh ) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure .
