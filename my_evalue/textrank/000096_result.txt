`` should upmc reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a kentucky medicaid provider , the department for medicaid services ... will be happy to expedite their application . '' upmc counters that kentucky medicaid told them that if they want to care for katie , they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept kentucky medicaid patients . while upmc spokeswoman wendy zellner did n't elaborate , a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low . asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take kentucky medicaid is `` an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state medicaid programs , '' zellner wrote .
