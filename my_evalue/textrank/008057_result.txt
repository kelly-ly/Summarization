the 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener . ah van had an early opportunity to give the vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out , although rhys hanbury 's pass was forward in any case . widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when brown , whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off ah van , forced the ball down from dummy half .
