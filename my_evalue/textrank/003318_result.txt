the well-off buying up homes in tourist hotspots has also driven up property values , leaving local people priced out of the areas where they grew up . that seems to me to be fair and , i have to say to you , i suspect people who own second homes here - many of whom have significant means - would like to chip in a bit extra so that they know that , even though they are not living in a community all the time , they are nonetheless supporting the local services that local people do rely upon . ' of course i believe in and want to protect people 's freedoms to buy holiday homes and second homes .
