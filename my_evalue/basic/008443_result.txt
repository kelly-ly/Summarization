mauresmo , who is to give birth some time in august , will be around eight months ' pregnant during wimbledon this summer , which is not finishing until july 12 due to the new three week gap between roland garros and the championships . therefore bjorkman is likely to have a key part to play as murray attempts to regain his title at sw19 â€“ something which , given his improved form during the first part of the season and his prowess on grass , is well within his reach this year . beyond that the 43 year-old swede may also come into his own , as it is unclear how this will affect mauresmo 's 26 week per year commitment to the scot , which is almost exclusively spent on the road .
