we visited l'ardéchoise site in the stunning ardèche region in south central france at the end of august . for us , entertaining our boys jake , six , and seb , four , is the number one priority on holiday - that and escaping the chaos that is our life in london . puerto pollensa , with its pine-shaded promenade , long sandy beach and fine views over the bay to craggy promontories , is the island 's most attractive and easy-going full-scale resort .
