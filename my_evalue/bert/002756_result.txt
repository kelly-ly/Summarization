if you are an aspiring manager in english football and you are black , you get used to one thing : when an opportunity comes your way , it’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass . with a few exceptions , you don’t get the better opportunities . just as predictably , there were also those saying ramsey’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance . the fact ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at qpr does not mean he is not a good manager .
