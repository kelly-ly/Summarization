england centre manu tuilagi is taking his rehabilitation ' week by week ' as the powerhouse midfielder continues his recovery from a troublesome groin injury that has sidelined him for most of the season . i 'm doing this training at st georges park . and then i had a scan again later on and they said `` it 's very bad '' - i split my pubus and ... it 's been tough since then . the squad will then embark on a trip to colorado in texas for a fortnight of high-intensity training at high-altitude before returning for three warm-up games against france ( twice ) and ireland prior to the tournament - and tuilagi is hoping to be back in the mix for selection by then .
