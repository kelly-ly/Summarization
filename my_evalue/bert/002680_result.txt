ap mccoy’s last chance of a national winner before he retires has evaporated after benvolio , his intended mount in this afternoon’s coral scottish national at ayr was withdrawn . mccoy will bring an end to his two-decade domination of jump racing after he rides at sandown a week today . mccoy , who recorded the 4,348th win when successful on capard king at ayr , said : ‘ it is disappointing not to be riding in the scottish national but the ground was going to be too quick for benvolio and , sadly , i could n't do the weight on any of the others . ’ mccoy will retire next week , but had been hoping for a final national success before benvolio withdrew .
