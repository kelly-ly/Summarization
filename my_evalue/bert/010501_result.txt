comments : veteran broadcaster peter alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ‘b*****ed up the game’ . but the equality act 2010 , drafted by the previous labour government , ruled that this was illegal discrimination , which means that women must now have equal access to the course – and pay the same membership rates as men . rant : he added : ‘ equality for women : a few people battled away to get it , they got it , and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people . ’ his view is a factual view to be perfectly honest .
