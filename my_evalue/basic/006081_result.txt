ten years ago , i signed a letter backing labour in the 2005 election . new labour recognised that the one helped pay for the other ; healthy tax receipts from business meant more money for schools , hospitals and helping the poorest in our country . i 'm genuinely concerned that this view is n't shared by the current labour party â€“ and that business is viewed as the problem , rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society .
