juve could have wrapped up their fourth consecutive serie a title with a victory on sunday and looked on course to after pirlo 's masterful set-piece from 25 yards gave them the lead in the first-half . however , matteo darmian equalised for the home side just before the interval and fabio quagliarella completed the shock comeback around the hour mark . juventus midfielder andrea pirlo puts his side in front against rivals torino with a stunning free-kick . his current contract at juve expires at the end of next season , but on this evidence it would not be a surprise if the club chose to extend it . despite defeat on sunday , juve are 14 points clear at the top of the league table .
