a travel-inspired jewelry company is targeting those commoners who dream of becoming the next kate middleton by marrying into the british royal family , with a playful necklace designed to help anglophiles map out their fantasy marriages . while the front lists one-year-old prince george and 30-year-old prince harry , as well as other more generic options such as ‘duke’ , ‘marquess’ , ‘earl’ , ‘viscount’ , ‘baron’ and ‘commoner’ , as the options for your future husband , the flip side offers eight ' future homes ' , allocating you anything from a palace , castle or estate to an abbey , manor , house , cottage – or even foreclosure . both pieces come in 14k gold vermeil and sterling silver . family event : prince william , who is awaiting the birth of his second child with kate ( pictured together last month ) , is already taken and therefore not featured on the charm .
