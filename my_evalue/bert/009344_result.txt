europe 's controversial new laws banning ultra-thin models from strutting down the catwalk may be doing more harm than good as models are reportedly going to extreme measures to ensure they clock in at a ' healthy ' weight when they hop on the scale - including stuffing their underwear with sandbags . but former model jennifer sky , 38 , from brooklyn , new york , has revealed in an op-ed for the new york observer that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations , explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted spanx in order to cheat the new bmi standards . while the model rights activist applauded the french government for attempting to protect the health of ' these young working professionals ' , she and lauren both agreed that outlawing skinny altogether is not the answer .
