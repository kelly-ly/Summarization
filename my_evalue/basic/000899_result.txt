let 's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average american , `` stuff '' happens ( keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running ) , paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck . to make the good news even better , tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people , with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free . taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich , who make their wealth off of their existing wealth , the largely untaxed returns from capital , rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us .
