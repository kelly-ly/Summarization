two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the mersey . after more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of tranmere 's faithful finally snapped when oxford moved decisively ahead , in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous saturday 's boat race . but they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation . aside from southport and chester there is wrexham , not far across the welsh border and a decent sized club , who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return .
