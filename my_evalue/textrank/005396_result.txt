we were told by mooresey [ coach peter moores ] that paul had been let go between sessions in the practice game against saint kitts . downton ( centre ) was sacked as ecb managing director after a dismal world cup this year . i think we’re third behind waqar [ younis ] and wasim [ akram ] and curtly [ ambrose ] and courtney [ walsh ] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other’s styles and constant communication .
