my introduction to ferme de montagne did not take place at this boutique hotel’s enviable ski-in , ski-out location in the french resort of les gets – it happened at the bar at the dorchester in london . i was impressed to discover that what suzanne and henry were really in town for was to check up on their 15 hotel staff – who spend a mandatory week working and gaining experience at the mayfair hotel before the start of each new season . ’ and , of course , a fit and happy team that spends a generous amount of time on the mountain will only benefit the clients of her boutique , chalet-style hotel where interaction with guests is integral to the ferme de montagne experience .
