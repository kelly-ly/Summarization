labour 's plans to impose rent controls are ‘ economically illiterate’ and will slash investment in new housing , leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords , experts warned last night . gordon brown’s favourite economist paul krugman , a nobel prize-winner , has warned that attempts to control rent always fail , writing : ‘ almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control , using its known adverse side-effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand . ’ the socialist swedish economist assar lindbeck once said : ‘ next to bombing , rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities . ’ alan ward , of the residential landlords association , warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past , adding they ‘ would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market’ .
