surgeons are calling for the rules on laser eye surgery to be strengthened after an apparent rise in patients receiving substandard care . poor night-time vision can occur if part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly . dr saj khan , an eye surgeon at the london eye hospital , said the unit is treating more patients who have received unsatisfactory treatment elsewhere than five years ago . a spokesman said that while in theory the operation could be done by someone who is registered as a doctor but does not have further qualifications , the likelihood of this happening is ‘ very , very negligible’ .
