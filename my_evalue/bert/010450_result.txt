a single bikini-clad woman silhouetted against a spectacular sunset , a tiny figure facing a swirl of stars , a hot spring whose improbably lurid hues seem like something from another planet - these stunning images combine colour and light to capture the wonders of the natural world . through my images i try to convey a sense of awe of the incredibly intricate and diverse world we share . its bright colours are caused by pigmented bacteria . i create art where the viewer is free to wallow in the mysteries and unknown of a beautiful landscape .
