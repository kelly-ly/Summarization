sirloin , topside and fillet are best saved for the roasting pan , chuck flank , rib-eye and skirt on the grill and when stewing go for brisket , shoulder and ribs . and when looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas , you want cuts that have a good marbling of fat . brisket . low and slow is the key phrase here , so get yourself a heavy bottomed casserole pot or slow cooker , and plenty of stock to allow for a long slow cook .
