ed balls has been accused of treating the public with ' contempt ' after dismissing as a ' joke ' the infamous labour note admitting the party had blown the nation 's finances . the shadow chancellor said the letter , left in the treasury by the former labour minister liam byrne in 2010 , was just a ' jokey note ' . mr balls blamed the lib dem minister david laws for leaking the note . the reason why we 're more credible than the tories now is that they 're not people who understand the need for change in the economy , it 's not been all in it together , they 've not even balanced the books â€“ it 's going to take a labour government to do it .
