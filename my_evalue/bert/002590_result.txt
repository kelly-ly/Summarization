tesco is under pressure to axe 200 stores — on top of 100 already closed or cancelled — after the supermarket giant announced a record annual loss of £6.38billion . tesco having four private jets tells you something about the culture of the place . over the years , i’ve flirted with all the supermarket delivery services , but , in the end , i settled for tesco because it always had the best offers on quality dishwasher tablets — and lots of convenient evening delivery slots . ultimately tesco has failed because it put quantity before quality .
