whether it 's a chocolate bar that no longer satisfies your appetite or washing powder which now runs out before your next shop , many of our big brands are shrinking their products . it 's time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stop people from comparing products to find the cheapest . ' angus kennedy , editor of trade magazine kennedy 's confection , says one of the worst examples of shrinkflation was cadbury 's reducing the number of creme eggs in a box from half-a-dozen to five in the run-up to easter ( both sizes cost £1 at iceland ) . ' especially when they 're still paying £1 for a sharing bag of maltesers that 's down from 140g to 120g ( in fact , cadbury 's fingers have gone up from £1 to £1.50 in sainsbury 's this year despite the shrinkage ) .
