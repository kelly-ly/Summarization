tottenham hotspur midfielder christian eriksen has warned that they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on qualifying for next season 's europa league . the lack of champions league football - which spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of tottenham 's size , but eriksen says missing out on the europa league would have the same effect . ' there are many games , of course , but if you have a big squad as we have , it should n't be a disappointment to play in europe . of course , it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in europe .
