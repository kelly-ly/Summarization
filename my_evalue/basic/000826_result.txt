twenty-nine elephants currently live here , and 13 more will join the group by 2018 , after ringling bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus . `` this was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time , '' said feld , chairman and ceo of feld entertainment , the company that owns ringling bros. and barnum & bailey . the ultimate decision to phase out the elephants , feld said , is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year .
