panama city , panama ( cnn ) ending a decades-long standstill in u.s.-cuba relations , president barack obama met for an hour saturday with his cuban counterpart raul castro , the first time the two nations ' top leaders have sat down for substantive talks in more than 50 years . his meeting with castro on saturday is n't being billed as a formal bilateral session , but obama 's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest-level engagement with the cuban government since then-vice president richard nixon met with fidel castro in 1959 . `` the reason we 're here is because the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation , focused entirely on seeking to cut off the cuban people from the united states of america had failed . '' earlier this week , mccain accused secretary of state john kerry of intentionally mischaracterizing what the sides had agreed to in the iran nuclear deal .
