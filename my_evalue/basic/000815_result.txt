exactly 365 days have passed since the girls were snatched from their boarding school dormitories in the dead of night in chibok , northeastern nigeria . for this we should all feel shame : shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs . caught in the blinding glare of global attention , and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings , the nigerian government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action ; offers of assistance from the likes of the us , uk , france , and china were accepted .
