barcelona coach luis enrique has sought to play down neymar 's petulant reaction when the brazil forward was substituted in saturday 's 2-2 la liga draw at sevilla . neymar , who scored a superb free kick to make it 2-0 to barca after lionel messi 's opener , was clearly furious at being replaced by xavi with around 20 minutes left and spanish media speculated he might be dropped for wednesday 's champions league quarter-final , first leg at paris st germain . beyond that you can speculate and draw the conclusions you want . ' messi ( centre ) takes part in a drill and the forward will need to be in top form to beat the french champions .
