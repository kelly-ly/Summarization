the team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the mars-sized body theia was of similar composition , or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact earth . in one theory , a team of scientists at the university of maryland said that the impact of theia with earth was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon . shown is an artist 's illustration of the young earth and moon . they found that 20 to 40 per cent of impactors had similar compositions to the planets they impacted , whereas planets that formed in the same simulation tended to have distinct compositions .
