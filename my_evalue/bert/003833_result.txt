eight years ago , after his ac milan team had beaten liverpool to win the champions league final in athens , kaka knelt in the centre circle , spread his arms out wide , tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication . david luiz , the former chelsea defender , used to drive to training with a ' christ is life ' sticker on his van when he was at benfica . it almost feels as if it would be better to throw pietersen into the fray and step back and watch the fisticuffs . the eccles cakes they used to serve at anfield take some beating but the garlic fries they serve at dodger stadium in los angeles went to the top of my list this week .
