confusion over ukip’s immigration policy grew yesterday after nigel farage called for the number of arrivals into britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . what we’re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in britain last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year . ‘let’s be honest , we can not have any debate about immigration about numbers while we’re members of the european union . ’ later in the day , suzanne evans , ukip’s manifesto chief , said the level of the cap might change .
