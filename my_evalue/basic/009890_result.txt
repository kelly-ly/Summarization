jos buttler appeals for a stumping as england dominated the second day of a farcical match in st kitts . the statistics will say that england , having bowled st kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match , rattled up 379 for six declared with both alastair cook and ian bell retiring out . the modern fixture madness that will see england play 17 tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win test series these days .
