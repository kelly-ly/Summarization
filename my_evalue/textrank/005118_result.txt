the researchers found the self-assembly of dna fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds . these connect together short dna chains to form long ones , without the need for a separate biological process . the new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions , the spontaneous self-assembly of small dna fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers , thereby providing a pre-rna route to the rna world , ' added professor clark .
