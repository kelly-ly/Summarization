sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others , a recent study claimed . while the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending , it can not of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved . putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents . only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at-risk families would mainly target the innocent .
