what alastair cook did here , particularly in the first hour of his innings , was spot-on . alastair cook 's innings into day three in grenada was spot on , particularly the first hour of it . perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket , perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again , but cook has been searching for the ball far too early .
