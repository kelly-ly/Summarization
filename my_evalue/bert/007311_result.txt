economy passengers have long wished they were in first class with lie-flat beds and nice meals , but now it seems there is someone else to envy - the cabin crew . cabin envy ! the deluxe areas were created after zodiac aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents . unlike the aerospace lower deck areas , the boeing crew rest departments ( crcs ) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane , or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers .
