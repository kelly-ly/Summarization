as someone who suffers from computer eye strain , i was alarmed to discover that prolonged exposure to gadgets such as iphones and ipads can cause irreversible damage to the eyes . a spanish expert , dr celia sanchez-ramos , has found the led screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness . however this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light . based on this research , she designed a screen filter called ' reticare ' , which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine .
