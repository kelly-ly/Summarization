munster have signed new zealand international francis saili on a two-year deal . utility back saili , who made his all blacks debut against argentina in 2013 , will move to the province later this year after the completion of his 2015 contractual commitments . saili has been capped twice by new zealand and was part of the under 20 side that won the junior championship in 2011 . this experience will stand to me as a player and i believe i can continue to improve and grow within the munster set-up .
