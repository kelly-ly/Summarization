last month some of the biggest names in music joined jay z for the launch of his premium music streaming service tidal . it is not known why the app has dropped so significantly but the price may be considered too high for some users . tidal is billed as the first artist-owned platform for music and video and the service aims to compete directly with spotify and apple 's music service , headed by dr dre . following the launch of tidal , spotify 's ranking jumped from 20th overall ( red ) to 16th in the us , and on 5 april it went from third on the music app chart to second place before falling again the next day .
