lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town . there apparently are n't enough good men to save sodom , which leads to god destroying yet another population in genesis . after god destroys sodom , lot 's daughters worry that there are n't any men left , so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him .
