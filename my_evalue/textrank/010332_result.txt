phillips would dearly love to reclaim the world title he won in auckland two years ago at this year 's world championships in belgium in july . i do have a target on me , because i have performed at a high level over the last few years and i have been world champion , ' he added . ' last year 's world championships was so frustrating because i sacrificed doing a few races before then because i wanted to chuck everything at retaining that title . ' phillips failed to defend his title last year , but is determined to take it back this july in belgium .
