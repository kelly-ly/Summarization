( cnn ) the verdict of the opinion polls on the uk election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between david cameron of the conservatives , ed miliband of labour , nick clegg of the liberal democrats , nigel farage of the united kingdom independence party , natalie bennett of the green party , nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party and leanne wood of plaid cymru , the welsh nationalists , there really was no clear winner . comres for itv , which staged the debate , had cameron , miliband and farage tied first with 21 % and sturgeon close behind on 20 % . an oddity of the seven up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved , sturgeon of the scottish national party and wood of plaid cymru .
