she added : ' they have baby cots and single beds with side rails , but they are n't safe as cody rolls around so much in his sleep and is restless all night long . ' we believe we have appropriate beds available to meet the needs of cody along with appropriate nursing support . ' however based on the options available her preference was for cody to have a mattress on the floor . ' mrs neatis and husband stephen , 45 , are full time carers not only to cody , but his brother dexter , seven , who is also disabled and has autism and adhd . other hospitals have these beds and special needs children are admitted to hospital more often than other children so i do n't understand why it 's so difficult here .
