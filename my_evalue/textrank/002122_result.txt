the england captain , without an international century for almost two years , failed for the second time in the first test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by west indies . the double blow at the start of england’s second innings left them with much to do in this first test to work their way towards a winning position at the sir viv richards stadium even though they earned a first-innings lead of 104 . benn was anderson’s first wicket caught at short leg since new zealand’s iain o’brien at old trafford in 2008 — his 78th test wicket .
