an obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant . however lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus . lizzi , who works a cleaner , kept fit by attending self-defense classes at t6 fight club in burslem , stoke-on-trent . i 'm really pleased , and i believe she will keep it off as she 's found a routine that suits her .
