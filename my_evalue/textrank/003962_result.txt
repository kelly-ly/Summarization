quirky collab : sister duo jess and stef dadon have teamed up with new york company ' print all over me ' . the photo-shoot was their own idea , which according to jess they ' threw together ' because they did n't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories . we don’t like to model , so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they don’t see us , ' says jess .
