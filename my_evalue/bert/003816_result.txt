preconceptions , i find , can be really unhelpful , so before travelling to the datai , a luxury hotel in malaysia , i decided not to find out anything about it . luxury personified : the datai hotel has all the colour and wonder of the emerald city , says maria mcerlane . it really was a first-class display from the jungle inhabitants . there 's the beach club specialising in mediterranean and international cuisine ; the gulai house , tucked into the forest and offering intensely flavoursome malay and indian offerings ; the dining room in the main building ; and the pavilion , a restaurant on 100ft-high balau stilts erected with the help of elephants ( yes , really ) .
