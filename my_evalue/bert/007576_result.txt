finding a place where you can experience some all-important family time , outdoor fun and a helping of luxury at the same time might sound like a tall order ... but if you 're partial to a weekend under canvas , family-oriented festival elderflower fields might be one of the best tickets you can buy this year . richard navarro and other musicians will be taking time from performing to run masterclasses in the youth music area . and do n't mention the legendary chocolate cake ... elderflower fields has more free activities on offer per child that any other festival , the organisers claim . the cocktail bar will be back with a new stage and late music for the night owls and two further bars will be serving up craft beers , local ales , ciders and more ... as the organisers are parents themselves they must know the value of having time to relax and unwind ... happy families from the last three years can vouch for that .
