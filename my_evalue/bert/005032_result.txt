sainsbury 's is set to revolutionise how we do our weekly shop by letting us scan items in our home as they run out . these prices will update automatically if an item goes on sale , or becomes part of a multi-buy deal for example . the app is an extension of sainsbury 's current scan-and-go scheme , which lets customers scan items on their phone as they journey around the store . if the wandsworth trial of the new app is successful , the app is expected to be rolled out next year .
