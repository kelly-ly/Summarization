the three-and-a-half minute video , titled ‘ never letting him book a hotel again’ , offers a glimpse into every traveller’s nightmare – dirty rooms , antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter . with scenes reminiscent of the inbetweeners films , the video was created by patrick miller and his friend , damien , who stayed at the family-run hotel last week when they travelled to the mediterranean island for a friend’s wedding . the deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris .
