this is an unusual and very sad case which involves the cremations act 1902 , ' she said . ' in a nutshell , the crown 's case is that the defendant told two different funeral directors , at two different times , that there were no objections from anyone , including mr barber , to her son being cremated and also signed two forms to the same effect . ' the crown says that the first time she did this she simply did n't know whether mr barber objected to the cremation or not , as she had n't bothered to ask . ' mr barber was not present at his son 's funeral or cremation despite every effort to do so . '
