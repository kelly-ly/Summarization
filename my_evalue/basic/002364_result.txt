not every greek island lets you rent a boat and potter about at will , but skopelos does . on day one , after manoeuvring our rented boat into sheltered waters off kastani beach , i cut the throttle and my girlfriend threw out the anchor . as the breeze pushed us back , the short anchor line quickly ran out until the end - then we heard a softer , more ominous splash .
