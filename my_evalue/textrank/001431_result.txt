a year since the death of former barcelona coach tito vilanova , his memory lives on at the club where he played an integral part in the most successful era in its history . while guardiola was the public face , vilanova worked hard behind the scenes as barca not only won trophies but did it by taking apart opposition teams with their brand of short-passing football that became known as 'tiki-taka ' . the pair knew each other from passing through barca 's youth system but vilanova was let go in 1990 and played for several lower league teams before finally getting his chance in the spanish top flight with celta vigo in the mid-1990s .
