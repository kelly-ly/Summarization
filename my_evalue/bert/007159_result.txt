a tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting . when he first noticed him eating , mr blackwell told his fellow councillors : ' it appears that one of our tory colleagues is consuming a full sunday roast dinner in the council chamber . ' i also tend to be quite flexible , but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much . ' no eating : the camden council chamber where councillor bucknell was forced to curtail his roast dinner .
