photographs taken with the very first ' secret ' handheld camera will go on display on saturday at the state library giving sydneysiders a rare chance to take a glimpse of what life in sydney looked like back in the 1800’s . these photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and kodak box photography . ’ you get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation . they received a ' wonderful response ' from the flickr community with some members even reaching out and helping curators identify where in sydney the photos were taken .
