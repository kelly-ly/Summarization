a british businessman and his partner were arrested in hong kong yesterday after their 15-year-old daughter fell to her death from their Â£7.5million apartment . there were claims last night that mrs cousins had originally moved to hong kong from the philippines in the 1990s and worked as a domestic helper before becoming the partner of mr cousins . it is believed the couple had been watching television in the family 's home on the 21st floor of one of hong kong 's most luxurious apartment buildings before blanca 's mother found her daughter was locked in a bathroom shortly before 2am . however , not having their births registered meant the girls would not have been able to get either compulsory identity cards or passports to pass through the territory 's strictly controlled borders , which suggests they spent their entire lives in hong kong .
