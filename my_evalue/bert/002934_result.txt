an obese woman has lost half her body weight after being told in front of her children she was too large to go on a fairground ride . the pair had been mortified with pictures of them as bridesmaids at a friend 's wedding - and they were determined to make a change . it was more of a walk but i persevered and now i run regularly , as well as watch what i eat . ' breakfast - cheese on toast or a large bowl of cereal .
