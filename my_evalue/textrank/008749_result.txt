police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in hatton garden , as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in los angeles in the 1980s . in both hatton garden and the la raids , the gangs bored into vaults using heavy drills ( pictured ) , broke in over a long weekend , set off an alarm on the friday that was n't checked out , and raided safety deposit boxes . the la raiders became known as the hole in the ground gang , and mr hoskins believes the group who raided hatton garden ( picutred ) must have known about them , or read the book inspired by them .
