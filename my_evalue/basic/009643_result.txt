gareth bale pulled up with a calf strain after just two minutes of real madrid’s league game on saturday and will almost certainly miss the second leg of the champions league against atletico madrid on wednesday . he will have further tests on the left calf muscle in the next 24 hours but the concern shown when he went down at the start of real’s crucial league game suggested his chances of recovering inside three days are non-existent and that he could also face a race to be fit for the champions league semi-final on may 5-6 . cristiano ronaldo was the first player to go across to bale as he sat waiting for treatment and the welshman’s expression spoke volumes – he knew he would not be able to carry on and could now miss out on real’s most important game of the season .
