campaigners have called for football clubs to install prayer rooms so muslim fans can pray in peace and avoid the possibility of anti-islamic abuse . currently both blackburn rovers and bolton wanderers have prayer rooms at their stadiums for the use of fans . because prayer times are based on the movements of the sun they differ from place to place .
