le manoir aux quat'saisons had been on my wish list for a while - and mum is such a huge fan of raymond blanc she once confessed he could be her mastermind subjectâ€¦ . the impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns , bronze sculptures ( including a scarecrow based on blanc himself ) , pathways lined with lavender and the walled organic kitchen garden - which supplies the restaurant with seasonal herbs , salads and vegetables . i loved every minute of it and learned so much - from interesting food facts ( who knew fresh-out-of-the-ground new potatoes were a healthier option than blueberries ? ) i had asked raymond which season was best to visit le manoir aux quat ' saisons .
