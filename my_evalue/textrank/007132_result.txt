odegaard picked real madrid over liverpool and manchester united at the start of the year but the record-breaking teenager is already experiencing how difficult it can be for young players in the spanish capital . real madrid castilla , managed by first-team coach in waiting zinedine zidane , were top of their regional third division when odegaard arrived at the club in january , but after he made his debut the teamâ€™s form dipped dramatically and following a run of four straight defeats , they dropped to seventh place , four points off the lead . if real madrid castilla fail to go up to the second division then odegaard will be loaned out next season .
