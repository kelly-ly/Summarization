at the start of the season i donâ€™t think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team , let alone scoring vital goals in a huge manchester derby . with all that money flashing around you would have picked angel di maria over juan mata , marcus rojo over chris smalling and just about anybody over marouane fellaini and ashley young . marouane fellaini has become manchester united 's go-to player in midfielder this season .
