this a carer partying with friends and kissing her boyfriend in the hours after taking cash from two frail pensioners she stole Â£5,000 from . rebecca calder , 24 , who was jailed for a year today , went out drinking on the same night she used her victims ' bank card to withdraw large amounts of money . liverpool crown court was told she had previously been employed by a company called makerfield care - who are no longer in business - as a carer although she was not part of the team who looked after the couple at their home in warrington . i hope this case serves as a stark warning to anyone who is put in a position of trust , like calder was , to look after elderly and vulnerable people .
