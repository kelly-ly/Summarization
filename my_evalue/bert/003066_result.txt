' welcome to the land of gnh ' was blazoned across the poster in front of me as i stepped off the plane at paro airport . i found myself walking through a canopy of brilliantly coloured prayer flags in the midst of sheer cliffs and deep gorges where spanish moss lay draped over the pine trees like frayed silk . i gazed enthralled as they greeted each other , puffing up their feathers while they danced and bowed to their mates at the nearby monastery in gangtey , we joined hundreds of local families at the black-necked crane festival , timed to coincide with the annual migration .
