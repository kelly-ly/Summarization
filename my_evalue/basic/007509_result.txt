great forests of pines , cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides , often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at dover , or in fine shingle and sand beaches , fringing a sea whose warm , sun-reflecting waters are of startling clarity . the famous curve of myrtos beach , as well as many little inland villages , are seen on the road to fiscardo . we landed at the island 's only airport near the capital town of argostoli , took a five-minute walk to the car-rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two-centre holiday .
