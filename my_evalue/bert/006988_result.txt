an ohio woman has spoken out in a reddit q & a about why she and her catholic husband made the painful decision to have a legal abortion at 23 weeks . when the couple learned that their unborn daughter had a chromosomal defect ' incompatible with life outside the womb ' , they decided that terminating the pregnancy was the best course of action . ' at the age of 23 weeks , the average baby is the size of a large mango . but because he practiced within a catholic institution , he had to seek special approval from the ceo and the ethics board , explaining that that the woman 's child would n't survive and that there were dangers in letting the pregnancy progress naturally .
