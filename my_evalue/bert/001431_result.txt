a year since the death of former barcelona coach tito vilanova , his memory lives on at the club where he played an integral part in the most successful era in its history . while guardiola was the public face , vilanova worked hard behind the scenes as barca not only won trophies but did it by taking apart opposition teams with their brand of short-passing football that became known as 'tiki-taka ' . barcelona went on to make a record start to a la liga season with 18 wins from 19 games but in december 2012 , vilanova was diagnosed with cancer for a second time .
