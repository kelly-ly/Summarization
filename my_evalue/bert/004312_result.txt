getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art , but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar . this could go on for about three rounds , in line with ebay rules , and could last up to a week . the study found that when the initial price is a round number , such as $ 1,000 , the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number , like $ 1,079 . there are some sellers who donâ€™t just care about price and , absent any other way of signalling that to buyers , they set their price at a round number .
