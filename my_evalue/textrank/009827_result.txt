on august 10 , 2014 , the church held a ' pig wrestling ' event where the animals were ' punched in the face , kicked , body-slammed , yelled at and thrown onto a barrel ' , according to the global conversation group . ' wrestling , as a sport , is contested by two human opponents , evenly matched , each of whom enters into the match voluntarily with mutually agreed-upon rules and a common goal , ' the group wrote on its website . ' not so in `` matches '' like pig wrestling , where frightened animals are unwilling participants exploited by teams of humans for entertainment . ' global conservation group said they consider the church 's decision a victory for their 260-day campaign and consider this a huge step for animal welfare . ' and we certainly consider this a huge step for animal welfare . '
