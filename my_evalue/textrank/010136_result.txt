the view of the blue waters of lourdas bay , kefalonia , a stunning greek island untainted by the masses . i 'm guessing two will be unknown to us all : euboea ( second biggest ) and chios ( fifth ) ; and two will sound familiar lesbos ( third ) and kefalonia ( sixth ) . on his holy day the body is passed over the ill and the sick in the hope of curing them . also worth a visit is the harbour of argostoli , where big turtles cruise up and down the waterfront looking for food .
