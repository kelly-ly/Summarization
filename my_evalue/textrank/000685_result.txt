the election could result in the handing of power from david cameron 's conservative government to the labour party , led by ed miliband -- or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties . of course there have been reform demands from smaller parties stiffed by the system , but since they never win against the two main parties , they 're powerless to change anything . that 'll mean -- as it did in 2010 -- that the spoils of victory could be claimed by whoever can successfully horse ( yes , horse ) trade to build a majority coalition alongside smaller parties .
