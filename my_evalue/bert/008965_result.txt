when rural farmer ashley stewart and his wife felicity found a baby male kangaroo on the side of the road in 2013 , they had no idea that the little joey would quickly become part of their family . two years on , the curious and friendly joey they have dubbed ' dusty ' is now so comfortable living with the couple and their dogs lilly and rosie on their farm , near esperance in western australia , that the stewart 's are convinced he actually thinks he is a dog too . we just could n't find him as kangaroos do n't make any noise and are very still , ' he said . ' unsurprisingly for a joey who has convinced himself he 's one of the pups , he often tries to get some of the dog biscuits too .
