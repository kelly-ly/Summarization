corporation bosses fear they could be losing younger viewers who are used to watching video online rather than through their tvs , and are promoting digital services in a bid to tackle the problem . the rise of catch-up tv , as well as the proliferation of digital services , has caused audiences to shrink dramatically - for example , the remake of poldark starring aidan turner attracted 6.9million viewers for its first episode , less than half the number who tuned in to the original series 40 years ago . it is thought that around 500,000 people take advantage of the so-called ' iplayer loophole ' , but that figure is likely to rise if more bbc services become online-only .
