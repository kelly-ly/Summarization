roberto martinez is backing ross barkley to become an even more influential player for everton and england after negotiating second-season syndrome at goodison park . barkley has had an indifferent campaign for the toffees on the back of his inclusion in last summerâ€™s england world cup party and a knee operation which disrupted his return to domestic duty . but england coach roy hodgson has kept faith with the 21-year-old and martinez believes his two substitute appearances for england against lithuania and italy over the past week have shown that the midfielder is ready to kick on again .
