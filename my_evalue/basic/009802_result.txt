a warning for a tsunami as big as one metre ( three feet ) forecast to hit islands in japan 's far south after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake struck off eastern taiwan was cancelled on monday . national broadcaster nhk said waves were possible on several islands in the southern okinawa chain after a very shallow quake centred on yonaguni in the southwest , near taiwan . nhk said the tsunami -- an irregular wave that alters the sea level , and not necessarily a huge event -- were believed to have already arrived at remote yonaguni , although no details were yet available .
