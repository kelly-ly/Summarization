concern that china could match u.s. underwater capabilities in the near future has encouraged the development of an unmanned drone ship to independently track enemy ultra-quiet diesel electric submarines over thousands of miles to limit their tactical capacity for surprise . initiated by a pentagon research group called the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) , the anti-submarine warfare continuous trail vessel ( actuv ) would be able to operate under with little supervisory control but also as remotely controlled or piloted vessels , depending on the circumstances of specific missions . `` we 're looking for test-ready , multi-sensor approaches that push the boundaries of today 's automated sensing systems for unmanned surface vessels , '' said scott littlefield , darpa program manager .
