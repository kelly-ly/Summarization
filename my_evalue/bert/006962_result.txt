charlie adam stunned the premier league with a goal from his own half in stoke 's clash with chelsea on saturday evening . david beckham struck from inside his own half for manchester united against wimbledon in 1996 . jone samuelsen . again , the hannover goalkeeper was up for a free-kick , but that should not detract from paderborn midfielder stoppelkamp 's achievement as the ball was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area and he simply controlled it on his chest , turned and volleyed the ball into the net from a scarcely believable 83 yards to make it 2-0 .
