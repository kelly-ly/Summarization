arsenal manager arsene wenger does not know the exact reason alexis sanchez chose the emirates stadium over anfield - but he is glad the chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for liverpool on saturday . sanchez had his selection of clubs once barcelona had decided to let him leave , and following the world cup , the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under wenger 's expert guidance , going on to make an instant impression in english football . the french coach , however , admits the possibility liverpool could use their interest in sanchez as leverage during negotiations over luis suarez 's move to the nou camp last summer was always on the cards .
