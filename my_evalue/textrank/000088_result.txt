apatosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and brontosaurus had five , according to the museum 's website , so marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names . paleontologist elmer riggs concluded in 1903 that the brontosaurus was really a young apatosaurus , and therefore must go by that name , according to the museum . emanuel tschopp , a paleontologist at the nova university of lisbon , portugal , led this latest study , which took five years and included visits to 20 museums in europe and the united states to collect data . by examining `` 500 anatomical traits , '' tschopp said he was able to `` reconstruct the family tree '' of diplodocids -- the family apatosaurus and brontosaurus belong to . tschopp `` looked at every single specimen , '' according to jacques gauthier , curator of vertebrate paleontology at yale peabody museum and `` noted their characteristics , '' plugging data into an algorithm that revealed `` five species in the group of diplodocids .
