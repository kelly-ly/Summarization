billy mitchell , now seven , was born with apert syndrome , a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull , face , hands and feet . finally , when he was a month old , mr and mrs mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister lois and older sister darcy , then five . the bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame , a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate .
