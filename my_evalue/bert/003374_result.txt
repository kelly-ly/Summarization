not one but two very familiar faces will be ranged against andy murray on the support benches as he revisits one of the most highly charged matches of his career . fitness trainer jez green ( left ) and coach danny vallverdu left murray to join tomas berdych 's team . much of the build-up to that fractious encounter centred on the fact it was a reunion between murray and his close friend and assistant coach dani vallverdu , who had switched jobs to work with world no 9 berdych . he admits to not being close to berdych .
