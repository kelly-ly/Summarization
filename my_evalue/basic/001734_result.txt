a moment of madness from england hooker tom youngs handed saracens victory but the second-placed londoners were frustrated by their failure to earn a four-try bonus . with leicester 6-0 up after 37 minutes , youngs was sin-binned for a barge on chris ashton , who had passed the ball to richard wigglesworth and as he tried to return the favour tigers matt smith grabbed it . saracens scored two tries with him off and the game was as good over at 14-6 when he came back .
