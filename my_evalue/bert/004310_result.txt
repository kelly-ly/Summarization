among the green rolling hills in the larung gar valley in china , the last thing you would expect to see in the countryside are thousands of red wooden huts that have been built in a massive cluster . the 34-year-old buddhist said the larung area has two small guest houses , but as these were occupied , he had to stay near the entrance . luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone , and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store . at night the view of the serthar buddhist institute is magical , with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills .
