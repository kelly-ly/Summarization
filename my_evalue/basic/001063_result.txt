the comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet tuesday night at the 2015 time 100 gala in new york -- right in front of fellow honorees kanye west and kim kardashian , who stepped around her as they moved down the line . the prank came the same night the third season of schumer 's hit show , `` inside amy schumer , '' premiered on comedy central . and it came the night after schumer appeared on cbs ' `` the late show '' and turned david letterman red-faced when she lifted her dress to show him a scar she got from surfing and said , `` that 's my vagina .
