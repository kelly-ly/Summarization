( cnn ) the verdict of the opinion polls on the uk election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between david cameron of the conservatives , ed miliband of labour , nick clegg of the liberal democrats , nigel farage of the united kingdom independence party , natalie bennett of the green party , nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party and leanne wood of plaid cymru , the welsh nationalists , there really was no clear winner . back in the 1950s , uk politics was simpler : labour and conservatives combined took 97 % of the votes . the impression so far is that britain 's voters do n't much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but do n't quite trust labour to continue the improvement .
