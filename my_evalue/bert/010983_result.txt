the new adam sandler film ran into a huge problem on wednesday when a group of extras stormed off the set . loren anthony ( above with nick nolte in the background ) was one of the extras who walked off set . i talked to a former instructor at dartmouth and he told me to take this as finally experiencing stereotyping first hand . filming also went on wednesday after the extras walked off , with director frank coraci even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees the native american extras found so offensive .
