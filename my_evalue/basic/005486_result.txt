mario valencia took a rifle from the super store on february 19 and was able to start firing it as soon as he left , something that should have been impossible due to the gun locks that are required on all weapons . police were even told the gun was locked by employees at the store as they pursued valencia , but just seconds later he began firing into the air according to cnn . when the gun was later recovered , after valencia was taken down by officer michael rapiejko , it was discovered the wire was loose , and only wrapped through the gun 's barrel and lock just once , not twice as is standard , allowing the weapon to be used as soon as it was taken .
