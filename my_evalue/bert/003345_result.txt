just another history-making day at this wonderful 79th masters saw dustin johnson become the first man ever to have three eagles in one round and yet still he couldnâ€™t lay a finger on jordan spieth . the difference between him and spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67 . one shot outside the projected halfway cut mark , he birdied the 10th and then , at the 13th , the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past , he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three . for 15 minutes , it was like watching tiger at his best .
