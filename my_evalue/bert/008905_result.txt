blackburn rovers boss gary bowyer has challenged star striker jordan rhodes to become an fa cup hero as the championship underdogs face liverpool in the first full house at ewood park since 2011 . blackburn boss gary bowyer has said jordan rhodes ( centre ) can become an ewood park hero . rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the fa cup quarter-finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at ewood park to see them lose to millwall , but bowyer said : ‘ there will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against millwall . ' blackburn’s run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching financial fair play rules .
