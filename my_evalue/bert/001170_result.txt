dick advocaat will not make the same mistake he did during his first season at rangers by playing down the significance of the old firm derby . advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the old firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . we lost that game and i remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset , ' it is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more ' .
