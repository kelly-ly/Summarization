keyes recommends credit cards are the best way to go if you want to quickly and easily rack up frequent flyer miles , which you can then use to take free flights . so right now , the best three are american airlines ' citi platinum card , the united mileageplus explorer card , and british airways visa signature card , each of which offers a sign-up bonus of 50,000 miles . ( for complicated reasons , i probably like the ba card the best , because if you 're flying less than 650 miles , 50,000 miles will get you as many as 11 free flights . )
