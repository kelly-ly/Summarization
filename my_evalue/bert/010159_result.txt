jurgen klopp would be perfect for arsenal but the club should keep faith with arsene wenger , according to gunners legend nigel winterburn . jurgen klopp has put a number of clubs on alert after deciding to leave dortmund at the end of the season . i would like arsene wenger to see out the next two years , and see where we are then , but obviously , with klopp leaving dortmund , it sort of puts the conundrum in because heâ€™s been linked with arsenal before , particularly when arsenal were struggling .
