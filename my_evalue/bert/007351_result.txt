disbelief . i’ve had close-up experience with three of the world’s five surviving species of rhino : the white rhino looks like the main battle tank of an extra-terrestrial army , while the black is more like a hot-rod armoured car . the horns were removed and they were sold on the asian medicine market . the effects of a powerful hangover can , people believe , be controlled — all it takes is one very rich man and one very dead rhino .
