since the news broke last weekend that hillary clinton had declared her candidacy , notable among the blitz of news stories are the many that refer to her as the mononymous `` hillary , '' as if she were a pop star in a pantsuit . the new york post published an item titled `` lena dunham backs hillary for president '' while gossip site tmz refers to the former flotus , u.s. senator , and secretary of state on a first-name basis throughout its news story on the announcement . and yet , despite her decorated career in government , we 've long called clinton by her first name , and her first name only , in a way we do n't do with men who have held similar , or even vaguely similar , positions of power .
