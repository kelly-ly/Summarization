everyone knows the tortoise beat the hare , but this little fellow has gone one better and beaten two cheetahs . by the time the older cheetah had made it to the top of the dune , the younger one decided to run off and follow rather than spend more time at the hard meal . ' it was something that was both exciting and naturally beautiful at the same time .
