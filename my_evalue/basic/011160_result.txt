sheffield wednesday claimed all three points against championship play-off hopefuls brentford with a 1-0 win thanks to kieran lee 's second-half goal . it took until the 35th minute for a decent chance to present itself when a whipped cross found caolan lavery in the box but the owls striker could not wrap his foot around it and the ball sailed wide of the post . the second half started in a livelier fashion to the first and that was evident after 49 minutes when some clever play from brentford around the box presented andre gray with an opportunity to get a shot on goal but his effort skimmed agonisingly past the post .
