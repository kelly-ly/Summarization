the swan come dine with me ice cream & gelato maker is best for dinner parties . half-fill it with crushed ice and four tbsp of salt , then place your ice cream mix , a 50/50 blend of milk , single cream , flavouring and sugar , in the metal cone-shaped container which sits inside , screw it together and shake vigorously for three minutes . rating : mandy 's best for budgets is the shake n make ice cream maker ( left ) but for kids the giant plastic ' ice cream cone ' ( right ) from john lewis is perfect .
