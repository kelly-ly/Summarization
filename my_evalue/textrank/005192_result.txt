he said microsoft has struggled with a 'chicken-and-egg ' problem , in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for windows because relatively few people use windows phones and tablets . microsoft hopes it has solved that problem by designing windows 10 so it 's easier for developers to build ' universal ' apps that work on a variety of windows devices , from phones to pcs and other gadgets , gownder said . currently , there are more than 1.4 million apps for android phones and about the same for apple devices , while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on windows phones and tablets .
