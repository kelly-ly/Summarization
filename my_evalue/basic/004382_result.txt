on paper chelsea’s team sheet looked like an insult , one for the anti-football brigade to get their beaks into after jose mourinho went without an orthodox striker . when reality bites , even his biggest detractors must concede that mourinho’s decision to leave didier drogba on the bench until the start of the second half was another tactical masterclass . at times you are left wondering what eden hazard , willian and oscar make of it all when mourinho starts working on team shape six days before a clash with arsenal .
