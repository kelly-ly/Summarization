mick schumacher made his official pre-season test debut in formula 4 on wednesday as he made his first steps towards single-seater racing in 2015 . the 16-year-old , son of seven-time f1 world champion michael , drew huge media interest to the oschersleben circuit in germany as he drove his van amersfoort car . while this was the first time the public were able to check out mick in action in his new car , his pre-season practice did n't quite go to plan as he was involved in a 100mph crash last month . however , german newspaper bild reported that the crash was minor and mick walked away from the accident uninjured .
