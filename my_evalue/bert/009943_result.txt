experts said the rise in the number of reported rapes and sexual offences was due in part to high profile historic cases like jimmy savile 's . but experts say the rise – the first since 2003-04 – was partly because victims were ' more willing ' to report sex crimes , including historical ones , and police were more likely to take complaints seriously , in the wake of the jimmy savile sex abuse scandal . a police watchdog recently found a fifth of crimes were not being logged properly . but the number of rapes recorded was the highest ever at 26,703 , which is an average of 73 attacks every day .
