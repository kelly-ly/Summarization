everton manager roberto martinez admits he would not be able to ease striker romelu lukaku through the remainder of the season even if he wanted to . lukaku struggled to find his form in the first half of the season after the world cup and he had only two goals to his name by mid-october . i thought he hit the best level and from that point on we have seen a completely different romelu : someone who was in control of his movements and then the power and pace was very effective . ' martinez believes lukaku has shown he can shoulder the burden which comes with his Â£28million price tag .
