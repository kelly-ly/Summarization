the home office was warned that lord janner was abusing young boys two decades ago but did nothing about it . but instead the paperwork was shelved by officials until it was discovered in 2013 and belatedly passed to leicestershire police . a spokesman for the former tory leader , who is now a peer , said he had ‘ no recollection’ of seeing the dossier but believes such material should have been forwarded to police . when the report was published in november it revealed a file on janner was among 114 dossiers on child sex abuse that went missing from the home office .
