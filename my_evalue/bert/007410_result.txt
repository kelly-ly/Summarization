if you ever wanted to go to the mad hatter 's tea party or follow the white rabbit round a strange world , then you had best head to the south coast of england . the chairs are shaped like teacups with plush cushions for comfort . jacqueline martin designed the incredible house in less than a year , sourcing the materials online from other countries on ebay and pinterest , finding trinkets in junk sales , or getting her family to help make bespoke items . i get numerous enquiries daily and i am very lucky as there is hardly any damage as people love the house as much as i do .
