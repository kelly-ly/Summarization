alfred hitchcock . his entire oeuvre , ackroyd suggests , was a study of voyeurism , violence and guilt with , on the one hand , the rape and murder of vulnerable women , and , on the other , the pursuit of a hero accused of crimes he did not commit . his very first work , in 1927 , the lodger , was about a man wrongly accused of being jack the ripper and , already , hitchcock could whip up an atmosphere of ‘ doubt and suspense’ , the camera dwelling on ‘ dark puddles shimmering with opalescent light’ . apart from conceiving patricia , ackroyd assures us , hitchcock and alma never had sex together again .
