adam federici lay inert on the turf for a moment . when the final whistle confirmed that it would be arsenal who will face either liverpool or aston villa here at the end of next month , federici , 30 , put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch , his thoughts fixed on some form of escape , some search for sanctuary . the match became a test of arsenalâ€™s fortitude as well as their class . jamie mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of danny williams on the edge of the box .
