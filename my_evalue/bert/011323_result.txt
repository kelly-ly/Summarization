a good samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying . but as he helped her for less than a minute , a traffic warden put a £70 ticket on his car – because mr hollinshead had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers . ' the undergraduate , who is in his final year of an arts and marketing degree at bournemouth university , took a photo of the smirking traffic warden during the incident on april 9 and posted it on twitter . this doesn’t surprise me .
