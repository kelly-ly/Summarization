de jong , a Â£6million summer signing from ajax , has made just three senior appearances for the club , the last of them in a 3-3 home draw with crystal palace on august 30 last year - his only league start to date . he took the first tentative steps towards a first-team return at st james ' park on wednesday evening , and while he knows there is more hard work to be done , he is glad to be back and already looking towards the start of next season . but i have to focus on next season and be really fit then and hopefully i can show the fans what i can do , and show myself and show my team-mates what i can do .
