a young woman has managed to find her doppelg√§nger after launching a campaign on facebook as a social experiment - and their likeness is mind-blowing . for the entire duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her . i think i have a two , maybe three at a push who resemble me . since meeting , niamh ( right ) and karen ( left ) - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on facebook ' constantly ' .
