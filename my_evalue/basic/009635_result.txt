slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father walter scott , 50 , who was fatally shot five times in the back in north charleston , south carolina on saturday . an indiegogo page to raise money in support of police officer michael slager had $ 393 of a $ 5,000 goal on thursday - the company told daily mail online ' they do n't judge ' as long as content fits their terms of use . a well-wisher of the accused killer cop gave a private donation to the fundraising page on indiegogo and listed their name as ' trayvon ' - perhaps in a twisted reference to trayvon martin , an unarmed black teenager who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in florida in 2012 .
