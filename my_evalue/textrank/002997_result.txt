lead author and professor of chemistry at the university , hongjie dai , said : ' we have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices , such as alkaline batteries , which are bad for the environment , and lithium-ion batteries , which occasionally burst into flames . ' our new battery wo n't catch fire , even if you drill through it . ' but lithium batteries can go off in an unpredictable manner in the air , the car or in your pocket . besides safety , we have achieved major breakthroughs in aluminium battery performance . ' and while lithium-ion battery can take hours to charge , the new battery has ' unprecedented charging times ' of down to one minute .
