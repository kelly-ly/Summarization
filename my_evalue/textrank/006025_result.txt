manuel pellegrini 's position at manchester city is under threat as they fight for fourth place . this is precisely the scenario that is facing manchester city as they weigh up what on earth they are going to do with a coach who can no longer motivate his players . to appeal to guardiola , he demands stability because he knows the training facilities , the stadium , the support and the financial power , through television rights , commercial arrangements and ticketing , is already in place . to fire pellegrini with six games left of the barclays premier league season would be an admission by cityâ€™s owners that anything other than the premier league trophy or the champions league warrants a dismissal .
