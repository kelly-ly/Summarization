upwards lightning is possible , but is very rare - with current estimates suggesting less than one per cent of lightning strikes travelling in an ‘upwards’ direction . upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to earth , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds . if this build up of charge reaches a certain level , the insulating capacity of the air breaks causing the negative charges to escape or ' leap ' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground .
