but now astronomers believe the bright light in the sky that triggered the conversion of paul the apostle may have actually been a falling meteor 2,000 years ago . they say descriptions of paul 's experience - in which he was blinded for three days after seeing a bright light - match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above chelyabinsk in russia in 2013 . paul converted to christianity after experiencing a bright light and a divine voice while he traveled on a road towards damascus in syria , as depicted in this painting by michelangelo , but it may have been a meteor .
