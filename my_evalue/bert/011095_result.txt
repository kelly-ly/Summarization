luca railton , 11 , was told he would never walk - but has now taken his first steps unaided . but his family refused to give up and combed the medical literature for alternatives , eventually coming across dr dror paley , an orthopaedic surgeon in florida . dr paley said he would be able to save luca 's leg and allow him to walk , so his parents began fundraising more than Â£100,000 to take their son to the us . each day for several weeks , his parents had to turn struts placed in their son 's leg to allow the bone to grow .
