as a rangers diehard who once saw treble dreams evaporate in the wake of a refereeing error that favoured celtic , john brown takes a predictably wry view of the anguish emanating from parkhead in recent days . brown could rant at refs with the best of them during his time in charge of dundee , not least when alan muir was fooled by a peter pawlett dive and awarded aberdeen a penalty that effectively relegated the dens park side . john brown was speaking to promote fan ownership group rangers first which has over 13,400 members .
