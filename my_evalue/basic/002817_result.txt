despite already re-shaping manchester united 's fortunes and guiding them to third in the barclays premier league , ahead of the derby with city , van gaal is pressing ahead with plans for more big name signings this summer . sportsmail revealed last week that germany centre mats hummels has indicated he 's finally ready to become a united player , and it now seems it will be as part of a £50m-plus borussia dortmund double after gundogan also gave van gaal the go-ahead to bid for his services . dortmund bosses are resigned to gundogan following hummels out of the door after the midfield anchorman flatly refused to renew a £100,000-a-week contract that runs out next year and evidently made little secret of his wish to join united .
