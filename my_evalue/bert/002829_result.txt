nick clegg today pleaded with labour and tory supporters to vote tactically to stop alex salmond in his tracks . mr clegg told reporters that the snp offered the ' politics of division ' . mr clegg said it was ' possible ' that the lib dems could come out of the election with more seats than labour in scotland because of the damage the snp surge could inflict on mr miliband 's party . and the labour party , astonishingly , just basically let that organisation disappear , just wither on the vine ... we 'll see where it ends up but i suspect we 'll weather the challenge from the snp a lot better than labour does .
