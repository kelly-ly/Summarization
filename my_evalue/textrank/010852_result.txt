but the duchess of cambridge may be in line for a more practical present for her baby – a supply of biodegradable nappies from her sister , pippa middleton . at £4 each , the mull-cloth nappies are not cheap and they are yet to really catch on in the uk . most of their appeal comes from the fact that they are made from natural fibres – meaning , unlike conventional nappies , they don’t end up in landfill heaps . pippa will be aware that kate adores natural clothing materials .
