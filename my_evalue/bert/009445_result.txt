while we all know the key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding a middle ground between the amount of food you eat and the amount of exercise you put in , it can sometimes be a bit tricky to anticipate exactly how much exercise is required . after eating only four mini solid chocolate eggs that contain 550 kilojules you 'll need to run for at least 40 minutes to melt the calories away . for those who like their easter with all the trimmings can expect to spend around three and a half hours on the squash court for women and just under three hours for men , before they’ll be able to burn off a large bunny which adds around 11060 kilojules to your daily calorie intake . for those who can go without the extra spread you’ll need to run for about 40-50 minutes to work them off .
