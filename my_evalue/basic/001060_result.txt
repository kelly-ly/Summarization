they have been edited for style and clarity for this article : anarie kennedy : the copy we have of the gospel of mary magdalene comes from the second century , but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older ( like first century ) ? one suggestion is karen king 's `` the gospel of mary of magdala : jesus and the first woman apostle . '' one thing that is worth adding is that the gospel is not actually called `` the gospel of mary magdalene . ''
