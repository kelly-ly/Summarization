( cnn ) the verdict of the opinion polls on the uk election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough : between david cameron of the conservatives , ed miliband of labour , nick clegg of the liberal democrats , nigel farage of the united kingdom independence party , natalie bennett of the green party , nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party and leanne wood of plaid cymru , the welsh nationalists , there really was no clear winner . as it is , election time media exposure has already seen miliband 's ratings as a leader improve . an oddity of the seven up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved , sturgeon of the scottish national party and wood of plaid cymru . last time labour won 41 of those seats : the more the snp take , the weaker labour 's chance of a majority at westminster will be .
