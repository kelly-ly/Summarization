the old woman tried to chase after the young boy , but soon after there was a loud scream as he fell into the drainage ditch . as soon as i pulled him out , his pour little belly looked like it was full of water , and kind of knew when i pulled him out that he was gone , ' said drake dufrene ( above ) the boy 's father . ' i hope never anyone has to go through what i 'm going through right now , because i 've never felt anything this hard in my life , ' said the boy 's father ( above with his mother ) .
