a greedy mother who told a 13-year-old volunteer to 'f*** off ' was evicted from a family easter egg hunt after she took more than her fair share of chocolate treats . she was escorted out of the racecourse , in melbourne 's south-east , when she became ' irate ' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many easter eggs . but he said this was the first year he had security guards escort a parent off site because they were taking too many of the 250,000 eggs donated by hillier 's chocolates . it was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $ 5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out .
