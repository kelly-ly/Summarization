labour and tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the chancellor 's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the government 's priorities . george osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country 's top earners , offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered . raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority , he said .
