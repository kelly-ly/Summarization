one fan , ade adebayo , 34 , from brighton was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket when they were released last week and here he tells us his story and his hopes for the fight . ade and his friends booked their trip to las vegas back in december in anticipation for the big fight . but all four of us had been to vegas before and we always said that if we were to go again then it would have to be for a big event or fight like this , so we thought it was worth going even if we did n't get a ticket .
