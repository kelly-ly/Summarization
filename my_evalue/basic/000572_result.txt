freedom of information -- always sounds like a good thing . and since blood tests require blood , you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed mr. cuban 's advice to get them all : anemia . decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well : more anxiety ( that ca n't be good for your health ) , more procedures ( which often involve needles , pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs ) and more treatment for `` disease '' not destined to cause problems ( as in over a million additional american men treated for prostate cancer , ditto women for breast cancer ) .
