watching his dad painstakingly filling small barrels of wine for oaking , he wondered why the wine couldn’t be stored in the same huge vats that had been used to ferment it . the idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle , leave for up to 48 hours ( depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy ) and — hey presto ! the celts weren’t wine drinkers but apparently were the first to use oak barrels to store and transport their beer and mead .
