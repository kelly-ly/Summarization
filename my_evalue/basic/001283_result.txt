david cameron will today warn english voters the snp 's new powers could impact their lives . mr cameron will call the idea the ‘ carlisle principle’ – named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the uk that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the scottish government . the scottish parliament’s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of england being unfairly disadvantaged – and require targeted tax cuts , mr cameron will say .
