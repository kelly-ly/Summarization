sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand-crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven . a £5 bottle has suddenly become £12 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling . the length of time you leave your wine in the oak bottle depends how oaky you like it — but it’s advisable to sample the contents regularly . i also think the oak bottle might actually improve the more times you use it .
