the bbc filled more than half its election tv debate audience with left-leaning voters , some of whom were brought in from scotland and wales , it emerged last night . when ukip leader nigel farage interjected and said they were prejudiced , ‘ even by the left-wing standards of the bbc’ , the audience only booed him further . the bbc told icm to make sure a fifth were so-called floating voters , and for every five labour supporters in the room , it made sure there were five for the conservatives , four for the lib dems , two for the scottish national party , two for the green party and one for plaid cymru . you have to ask yourself what would have happened if the audience had been right of centre .
