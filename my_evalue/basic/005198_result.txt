english essential : this laminated document announces the new isis nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . the latter rule is something that even the nhs has yet fully put in place , with nurses who trained in european countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the nursing and midwifery council testing eu candidates . it states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25 , pass an entry exam , impress during an interview , graduated from secondary school with science qualifications , be willing to travel to any isis-held area , and willing work for isis institutions for at least two years after graduating .
