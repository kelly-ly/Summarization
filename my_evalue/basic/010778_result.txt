barcelona coach luis enrique has sought to play down neymar 's petulant reaction when the brazil forward was substituted in saturday 's 2-2 la liga draw at sevilla . neymar , who scored a superb free kick to make it 2-0 to barca after lionel messi 's opener , was clearly furious at being replaced by xavi with around 20 minutes left and spanish media speculated he might be dropped for wednesday 's champions league quarter-final , first leg at paris st germain . luis enrique declined to reveal who would start the match at the parc des princes but did make it clear that he was the one in charge and urged all his players to respect that .
