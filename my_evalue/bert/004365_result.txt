the mortgage market has reached a ‘watershed’ moment with the launch of the first five-year fixed rate below 2 per cent . the offer from one of the country’s biggest mortgage lenders – hsbc is consistently in the top five – launches on monday and is expected to trigger a flood of rate cuts by other banks and building societies . fifteen lenders had already cut rates across their ranges in the past week , but more are likely to follow now hsbc has set a new benchmark . but brokers warned that tougher lending criteria meant these cut-price deals were not available to everyone , including older borrowers and the self-employed .
