( cnn ) mullah mohammed omar is `` still the leader '' of the taliban 's self-declared islamic emirate of afghanistan . the taliban 's `` cultural commission '' released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement 's website , ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an april 4 , 1996 , meeting in afghanistan 's kandahar province when an assembly of afghans swore allegiance to omar . though taliban militants have continued to battle the u.s.-backed government across afghanistan , omar has not been seen or heard from in years .
