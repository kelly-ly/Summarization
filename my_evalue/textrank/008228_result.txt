watson , who finished 38th at augusta national on sunday as the defence of his masters crown finished in disappointing fashion , was struggling on one over after 13 holes on thursday - having started on the back nine - but three successive birdies got him back under par . the american 's 70 leaves him in joint 17th place , with home hope huang setting the early running on a day when he shared the highlights with an byeong-hun , who recorded a hole in one . china 's huang , who only started playing at the age of 22 some 12 years ago , carded eight birdies and two bogeys in his six-under-par round as he finished the first day one clear of a group of four players . among them are american peter uihlein after he completed the final 10 holes at genzon golf club in six under par , and south korea 's byeong , whose ace came on the 226-yard eighth - his penultimate hole - as he finished birdie-par-eagle-birdie .
