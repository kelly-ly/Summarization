shelly sterling has been awarded nearly all of the $ 3 million she had sought to be returned from v. stiviano , who had argued that the gifts were made when donald sterling was separated from his wife . testimony in los angeles superior court was n't as clear-cut even after sterling 's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks donald sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of stiviano 's $ 1.8 million spanish-style duplex near beverly hills . while an accountant for sterling conservatively estimated that stiviano got more than $ 3.6 million in sterling gifts that included a ferrari and paris shopping spree , o'donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $ 1 million in cash , saying the lower figure lined up with stiviano 's own admissions on the witness stand , depositions and court filings .
