a 10 tonne ' fatberg ' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of london 's most exclusive streets . the enormous lump , which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes , was so heavy that it caused the 1940s sewer in chelsea to break . utility companies , including thames water , discovered the fatberg when local residents and businesses on draycott avenue and walton street started to complain about the rancid smell coming from the sewer .
