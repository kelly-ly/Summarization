taken over five years , the footage includes plasma raining down on the sun , an extreme solar eruption and even a comet breezing through the sun’s atmosphere . another incredible part of the video shows ‘ coronal rain’ streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun’s surface . by watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona , which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun , what heats the sun 's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface , and why the sun 's magnetic fields are constantly on the move .
