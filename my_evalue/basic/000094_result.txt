( cnn ) just eight months ago , a young woman named fatu kekula was single-handedly trying to save her ebola-stricken family , donning trash bags to protect herself against the deadly virus . today , because of a cnn story and the generosity of donors from around the world , kekula wears scrubs bearing the emblem of the emory university nell hodgson woodruff school of nursing in atlanta , where she 's learning skills she can take back home to care for her fellow liberians . david smith , an associate dean at emory 's nursing school , said they accepted kekula because they were struck by how both she and emory each treated four ebola patients at around the same time last year -- and emory had dozens of doctors and nurses and millions of dollars in technology while kekula had nobody and nearly no supplies .
