these small reminders of college life at this kenyan school belie the horror of what happened here : the slaughter of at least 147 people , many of them students who lived in this building . on friday afternoon , more than 36 hours after the attack , investigators and kenya red cross crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students . the corpses of four al-shabaab attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their ak-47s -- remained where they fell , their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets .
