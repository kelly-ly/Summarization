this got femail thinking about how many child stars have grown into stunning adults , and how many have n't ... have n't you grown : we got a sneak peek at zac efron 's hot bod as well as his new film , bad grandpa , on tuesday . then there 's taylor lautner , who has such a baby face we still consider him to be a youngster , but at the grand old age of 23 and with some manly facial hair , he 's now made it onto our list . macaulay culkin won our hearts as the mischievous young kevin in the home alone trilogy , but somehow evolved into a greasy guy who looks , well , a bit weird ... ed furlong was a heartthrob for youngsters brave enough to watch the second terminator film , but his career took a dive due to multiple arrests , alcoholism and substance abuse .
