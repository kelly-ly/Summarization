a beautiful sunny evening and i am having a drink in the garden with friends . oh mum , ’ they would complain , ‘ lay off , there’s nothing there . ’ i had seen the scratching and i could feel the prickle on my own scalp . pretty much every foreign holiday i have taken in 15 years has involved one shaming incident where i have to mime the action of headlice in a foreign chemist’s shop — in italy they are called pidocchi , in germany , kopflause .
