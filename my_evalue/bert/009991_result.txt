the next stage of evolution may well be upon us after a monkey unscrewed the lid of a water bottle and took a drink . the monkey interactes with a tour guide , who squirts water at it from a hole in a water bottle in a bid to cool it down . the monkey recieves the bottle and holds it in its hands before attempting to quench its thirst . before gently wiping its mouth and having another drink of water .
