the fca said the bank had an ‘ inappropriate policy’ for its complaints handling in 2011– instructing staff not to search for ppi complaints relating to loans and mortgages that had been repaid more than seven years prior to the complaint . but the wrongdoing escalated in may 2012 when a team of staff started to provide false information to the financial ombudsman when it was investigating complaints on old ppi policies . the financial ombusdman continues to be swamped by 4,000 complaints a week , but banks complain that claims management firms – which bombard customers with nuisance text messages and phone calls – are driving many people to make bogus ppi complaints .
