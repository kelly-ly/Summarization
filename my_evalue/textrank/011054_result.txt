that term needs to be abandoned and early referral for investigation and diagnosis-based treatment should instead become the norm . ' back pain is ' very often under-investigated ' , adds surgeon robert lee , of the spire hospital in bushey . ' he adds : ' most back pain is the result of muscular strains , and is short-lived . ' as long as there are no ' red flag ' symptoms - such as numbness around the groin and difficulties passing urine or with your bowels - then painkillers and physiotherapy are good approaches . ' however , an mri should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly . ' for instance , arthritis may be relieved with a simple painkilling spinal injection . much more rarely , spinal tumours are malignant .
