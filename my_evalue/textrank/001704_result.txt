water in the air , even in dry areas , can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice . the system works on the premise that rainfall takes place when supercooled droplets of water form ice crystals . water in the air , even in dry areas , can be transformed into ice crystals by seeding the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice .
