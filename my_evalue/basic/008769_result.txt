jordan spieth 's first outing after winning the masters did not go according to plan as he finished the first round of the rbc heritage on three over par . the 21-year-old has enjoyed a whirlwind few days since dominating in augusta to win by four shots from justin rose and phil mickelson , but that rollercoaster ride interrupted his preparations here as he did not play a practice round and he looked tired as he struggled in difficult conditions in south carolina . he pulled one back with a birdie on the par-five 15th , but nevertheless finished well off the pace with three-over 74 even as the conditions kept the scoring under control .
