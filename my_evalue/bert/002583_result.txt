labour will today accuse the tories of making it harder to see a gp as they attempt to put the nhs back at the centre of the election campaign . the party will launch a billboard advert using the image from the famous 1979 ‘ labour isn’t working’ poster , but instead it will warn : ‘ the doctor can’t see you now’ . labour will warn that new official figures show 600 fewer gp surgeries across england are now open in the evening and weekends compared to the last election . a number of surgeries were found to have long lines of patients waiting outside at 7am in a bid to try and get same-day appointments .
