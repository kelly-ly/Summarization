the post by lewis helget , 27 , appeared on darren goddard 's timeline when he logged into the social networking site with the intention of deleting his account . mr goddard ' cried himself to sleep ' when he parted ways with lewis in 1989 after his marriage broke down following a horrific car accident . but it still took me two years to get over the fact i was never going to see him again . ' lewis , who lives in emsdetten in north west germany , was finally reunited with his father in march .
