ben stokes starred with the ball on the first day of england 's warm-up match in st kitts , but it was the runs of alastair cook and jonathan trott that pleased him most . to see him go out and score some runs , the way he has been known to for england over the last five years , was really good to see . ' stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of cook 's knock , but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores , it could yet prove an important effort . hopefully that is just the start .
