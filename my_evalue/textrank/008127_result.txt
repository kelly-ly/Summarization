maria , 47 , who started her business four years ago , says she has seen an increasing number of people seeking help after getting diy tattoos . ' we are not against tattoos here at all , but diy ones can lead to problems , ' she said . ' sometimes people come in and it 's scarred because they have pushed the needle too far in and dragged it . ' we 've definitely seen an increase in people coming to us with home made tattoos since we opened .
