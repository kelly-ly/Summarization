when louis van gaal talked about michael carrick and wayne rooney as coaches on the pitch last week , it actually revealed far more than you might at first imagine . carrick and rooney have football intelligence in abundance : hence carrick slipping seamlessly in and out of the centre-half position mid-game at times this season , and rooney slotting into whichever position van gaal asks him to occupy . not very bright . and this issue of a lack of football intelligence in the squad and at the club needs a long-term solution .
