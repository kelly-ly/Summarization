malaysia has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for islamic state extremists in the country in a move opponents denounced as a harsh blow for civil rights . human rights watch described it as ' a giant step backwards for human rights ' . its passage was not in doubt due to the ruling regime 's majority in parliament . in particular , the terror legislation has revived concerns of a return to a previous draconian internal security act that allowed detention without trial and was repeatedly used against opposition politicians .
