former rangers manager walter smith has praised stuart mccall for making an impact at ibrox - but he maintains ally mccoist was given little chance of succeeding . smith , who was attending a john hartson foundation golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness , said : ' the guys worked with me for four-and-a-half years there and did a great job for the club , and i was hoping they would get a good opportunity . ' mccall played under smith for seven seasons , winning six titles in the process , and the 67-year-old was pleased to see the former motherwell boss take over , despite his pain at the exits of former assistants mccoist and mcdowall .
