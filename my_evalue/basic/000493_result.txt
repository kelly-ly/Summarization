north korean leader kim jong un has backed out of next month 's visit to moscow for world war ii anniversary celebrations , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said thursday . the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of north korea in late 2011 . he was to have met with russian president vladimir putin as part of the may visit to coincide with victory day , marking the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii .
