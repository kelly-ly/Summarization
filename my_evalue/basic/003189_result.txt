â€™ steve davis ( left ) and dennis taylor pose with the trophy before their world snooker final in 1985 . davis was leading the final 8-0 when he missed a shot on the green that he has rued to this day . before reliving those late agonies , we should go back a little further because davis remembers the turning point of the match not as the black he overcut with his last , disastrous shot of the tournament , but something as innocuous as a green ball in the ninth frame .
