david templeton has delivered a damning critique of the training-ground methods deployed at rangers by ally mccoist and kenny mcdowall . the tempo of training , the intensity , everything has been right up and it has been really enjoyable actually , but tough . we were gifting too many goals and i think that was just through not working on the back four or back three , whatever we were playing . templeton has singled out the change in formation and new-found intensity as behind the improvement .
