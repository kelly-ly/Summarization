sam allardyce believes queens park rangers goalkeeper rob green is good enough to challenge england no 1 joe hart for a place in the national team . green , capped 12 times , endured a famously turbulent time as england goalkeeper , with his calamitous error in england’s 1-1 draw with usa at the 2010 world cup a particular lowlight . and allardyce , whose side face green and co at loftus road on saturday , still holds his former stopper in high esteem and thinks the 35-year-old could once again stake a claim to be england’s main man between the posts .
