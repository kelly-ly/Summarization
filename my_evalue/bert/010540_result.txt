an australian doctor is the face of the latest islamic state propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of its own health service in syria . the propaganda video shows a man with an australian accent who calls himself ' abu yusuf ' and calls on foreign doctors to travel to the isis stronghold raqqa to help launch the ishs ( the islamic state health service ) , which appears to be mimicking britain 's national health service . the video also features an indian physiologist called abu muqatil al-hindi , who says the physical therapy centre is ‘ one of them most important areas that any hospital should have . ’ nine british medical students have travelled to syria to work in hospitals in islamic state-held areas .
