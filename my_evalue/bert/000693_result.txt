( cnn ) isis operatives have executed two groups of prisoners , believed to be ethiopian christians , in libya , according to a video released sunday by the terror network 's media arm . at the beginning of the video , a man who appears to be a judge in a court enforcing islam 's sharia law holds up documents and says a syrian christian had owed a syrian muslim 550,000 syrian pounds ( about $ 2,900 ) since 2004 , but the muslim was unable to obtain the money under president bashar al-assad 's regime . the law cited throughout the video comes from the quran 's surah 9:29 , whose exact translation is an area of dispute among religious scholars . those captives , too , wore orange jumpsuits .
