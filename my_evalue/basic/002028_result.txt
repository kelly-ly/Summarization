lance armstrong has said the world anti-doping agency and others are ' owed an apology ' from him for cheating during his cycling career - but noted that the agency 's chief rebuffed efforts to meet back in 2013 . david howman , director general of wada , said this week that he is disappointed armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs . armstrong initially declined comment on howman 's remark , but on wednesday provided the ap with a may 2013 email exchange with howman , who initially indicted he could meet with armstrong , then backed off under advice from wada lawyers .
