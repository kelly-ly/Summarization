andy murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow british tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of aljaz bedene into the home ranks : don’t complain . at present any grumbles are happening in private , and bedene’s present ineligibility for the davis cup team has made it less of an issue , although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the international tennis federation . if he was 500 in the world they wouldn’t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit , ’ said the 27-year-old scot . ‘ i would hope that all the guys who are below him now , like james ward , kyle edmund and liam broady , will use it as motivation .
