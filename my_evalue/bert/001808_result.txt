lewis hamilton has described his champagne-spraying of a grid girl after the chinese grand prix , which has drawn widespread criticism , as ' a fun thing ' . in a typical moment of exuberance that comes with a victory for any driver , and following the playing of the national anthems , hamilton grabbed his bottle of bubbly and for a fleeting moment turned it on grid girl liu siying . obviously when you arrive ( at the circuit ) you get a debrief as to what has happened during the week , so fortunately for me it has not overshadowed my week . ' if she had wrote in and said she was really unhappy then perhaps i would be more concerned . '
