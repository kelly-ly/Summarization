there is a problem with england 's top order and it is not an easy one to solve . ben stokes was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play as england reached 341 for five . thanks to those two and ben stokes , this turned out to be very much england 's day . it 's difficult to do that at times , being on the other side of the fence now with the media , but my heart is in english cricket and i want england to do well .
