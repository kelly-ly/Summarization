nicola sturgeon this afternoon scoffed at claims by labour leader ed miliband that he would never do a deal with the snp to become prime minister - insisting he will ' change his tune ' after the election . if that remains the case on may 8 if he does n't have a majority , what he will be saying to the people is rather than work with the snp if there is an anti-tory majority , he 'd rather watch david cameron waltz back into downing street . ' mr cameron said he made ' no apology ' for focussing on the threat posed by the snp in the election next month . meanwhile , conservative home secretary theresa may told the mail on sunday that a labour/snp government could be ' the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication ' , when king edward viii gave up the throne in 1936 .
