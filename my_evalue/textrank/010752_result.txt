' terror birds , or phorusracids as they are also known , were a group of carnivorous birds that grew up to 10 feet tall and had large hooked beaks . he said : ' it is not possible then through this to know exactly what kind of sounds terror birds were capable of produce . ' however , based on the hearing frequencies that we know that they were able to hear , it is possible to state that llallawavis may have produced sound of low frequency . ' this will allow us to infer if terror birds were diurnal , nocturnal or crepuscular . '
