( cnn ) so now the real trial is underway : what does the surviving boston marathon bomber , dzhokhar tsarnaev , deserve and why ? after all , he was only 19 . what outcome would i predict in the tsarnaev case ? confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones , hearing offsetting pleas to `` move on , '' balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits tsarnaev , i expect the jury will vote 10-2 ( or 9-3 ) for death .
