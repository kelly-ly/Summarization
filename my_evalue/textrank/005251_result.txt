it is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3d view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky . of course , we canâ€™t actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies . studying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped , based on its gravitational effects .
