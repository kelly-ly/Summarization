the snp will help make ed miliband prime minister even if labour finish 40 seats behind the tories at the general election , nicola sturgeon said last night . while mr miliband has ruled out going into coalition with the snp , ms sturgeon 's remarks raise the prospect of labour ruling as a minority government - despite winning fewer votes and seats than the tories . the institute for fiscal studies accused the major parties of keeping voters ' in the dark ' by spelling out only the ' broad outlines ' of their tax and spend plans following the may 7 poll , though it singled out the liberal democrats for being more transparent than their rivals about their intentions . ed miliband , pictured in chatham house , central london today , could become prime minister even if he wins fewer votes and mps than david cameron .
