characterised by their long beak and large throat poach used for catching prey and draining water , pelicans are already aesthetically peculiar looking birds . capturing the footage in santa barbara , california , scott kaiser filmed the back of the large pelican sitting on a post overlooking the water . recording the bird in slow motion , the video maker later noted that the pelican looked majestic , content and relaxed at this point in the clip . the bird then closes its mouth while looking up at the sky and the air sacs in its throat begin deflating once again as it settles back down .
