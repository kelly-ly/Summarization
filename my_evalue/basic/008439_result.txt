denmark 's crown princess mary might have wowed in a succession of evening gowns last week but sunday was all about low-key family time for the australian-born royal . mary , 43 , treated her three youngest children , princess isabella , seven , and twins princess josephine and prince vincent , four , to a day out at a farm in kirke hyllinge , a village in zealand . the three children , meanwhile , were well-wrapped up in cosy padded jackets and appeared fascinated by the cows grazing in one of the barns , with prince vincent even climbing a fence to get a better look .
