if he wins , spieth would become the second-youngest winner in masters history , five months older than woods when he won his first major in 1997 . spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in masters history , joining craig wood in 1941 , arnold palmer in 1960 , jack nicklaus in 1972 and ray floyud in 1976 . no player in masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but spieth flirted with it saturday , making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18 , and could threaten again sunday .
