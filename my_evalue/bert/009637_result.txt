itâ€™s one of the most boring kitchen jobs ; prepping a mound of potatoes for mash . once all your spuds have been prepared put them in a pan on the hob and add some boiling water from a kettle . the process starts by running the blade of a sharp knife carefully around the middle of the potato , without letting it cut through , making sure to get the line to meet on the other side . leave the potatoes to cook .
