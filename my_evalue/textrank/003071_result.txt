the finish might have been uncharacteristically scruffy , scored after his first shot came back off the keeper , but it was a landmark goal for lionel messi at the nou camp on saturday as he made it 400 goals for barcelona in a 2-0 win over valencia . messi scored with the last kick and luis suarez scored with practically his first , putting barcelona 1-0 up after just 56 seconds . barcelona were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with bravo releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from suarez past diego alves into far corner .
