rita wilson appears with an ensemble of actresses in a satirical new video promoting gender equality which ironically proclaims : ' it 's only fair that men should have it all . ' the clip , which was created by the make it fair project , presents a string of statistics that highlight the disproportionate presence that men have in influential industries like hollywood , which means that , more often than not , males hold 70 to 95 per cent of the industry’s most important positions . ' in the past three years , only 93 per cent of films were directed by men , and only 80 per cent were written by them , ' the actresses , including meryl streep’s actress daughter mamie gummer , say at the beginning of the video .
