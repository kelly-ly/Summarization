physicists at cern , the geneva-based organisation which runs the lhc , are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device 's upgrade . it was shut down two years ago - after confirming the discovery of the higgs boson - so that its energy levels could be almost doubled , allowing scientists to carry out more extreme experiments . now the physicists operating the machine have their sights on dark matter , the invisible , undetectable material that makes up 84 per cent of matter in the universe and binds galaxies together yet whose nature is unknown .
