treatments available mean hiv is now a manageable disease â€“ but late diagnosis can have a devastating impact on health and life expectancy . biosure founder brigette bard said it is a significant step towards normalising hiv testing , adding : ' knowing your hiv status is critical and the launch of this product will empower people to discreetly test themselves when it is convenient to them and in a place where they feel comfortable . ' positive test results need to be confirmed by a healthcare professional and those in high-risk groups are recommended to be tested every three months . the only alternative currently available is ' home sampling ' , which involves collecting a blood sample 160 times larger than that for the self-test and posting it to a laboratory , with results given five days later .
