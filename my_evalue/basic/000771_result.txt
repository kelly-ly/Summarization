( cnn ) the hillary clinton presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the clinton family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called `` clinton cash : the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich '' by peter schweizer , coming out may 5 . my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt team clinton to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary americans -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to bill clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state hillary clinton . and several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the u.s. government were donors to the clinton global initiative , a sister group that was spun off from the clinton foundation .
