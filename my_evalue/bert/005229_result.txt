the case of a british woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose . but speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday , ms speirs 's brother paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was ' an outrageous lie ' to say his family were all addicts . and he said that her friends had noticed changes in ms speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old mr adusah , who was based in britain but is originally from ghana . he has been active as a preacher in britain since 2010 .
