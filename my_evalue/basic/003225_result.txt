david luiz should not play in central defence again after his horror show in psg 's 3-1 defeat against barcelona , according to former england boss glenn hoddle . the ex-chelsea defender came off the bench in wednesday night 's champions league quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by luis suarez in the build-up to the uruguayan 's two goals . luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but hoddle , who insists that the brazilian has always been a defensive liability , believes he still showed his naivety even if he was n't fully fit .
