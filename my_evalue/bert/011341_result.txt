an amazing map revealed by nasa has shown where lightning occurs most on earth . according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans . the heating and weather patterns are unstable and changeable at that time-just before the onset of the monsoon , which brings plenty of rain but much less lightning . this comparable nasa map shows global lightning strikes from january 1998 to 2013 from the nasa/msfc lightning imaging sensor .
