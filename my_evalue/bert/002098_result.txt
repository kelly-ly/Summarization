professor ninian peckitt , 63 , has been struck off after a hearing heard that he punched a patient in the face ten times to fix a broken cheekbone . i think the first time he punched the patient i was n't holding him and it was then that i was instructed to do so by prof peckitt . ' i particularly [ did n't want to ] write the note because accurately i would have had to write `` prof peckitt punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma '' and that 's not something i would have wanted to do . ' the panel is of the view that the public interest requires that it be made clear that mr peckitt 's behaviour is unacceptable in a member of the medical profession . '
