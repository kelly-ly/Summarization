marlon samuels found a novel way of carrying on his duel in the second test with ben stokes here on thursday night when he sent him on his way with a military-style salute . stokes had given his wicket away just before the close of the third day when he smashed a devendra bishoo long-hop straight to deep square leg and samuels wasted no time in pouring salt on his wounds , saluting him on his way . i didn’t really see it , but there’s nothing wrong with a little banter in international cricket , ’ said ambrose . ‘ heavy money on @ benstokes38 getting marlon out in the 2nd dig .
