over the years i’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in lorena ochoa and laura davies . but none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with charley hull , the best teenage golfer in britain . teenager hull possesses the same ‘wow’ factor as world no 1 rory mcilroy ( below ) .
