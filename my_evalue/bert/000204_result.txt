( cnn ) much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the mediterranean this year , increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year . so we do not know how many boats tried to enter australian waters with asylum seekers . at the same time , the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the asia pacific region has increased ; they are just not making it to australia yet . the australian government 's ability to `` stop the boats '' -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors , including tolerance from indonesia , significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers .
