barkham’s book is written to celebrate 50 years of enterprise neptune , the national trust’s campaign to save our coastal beauties from being spoiled — by purchasing them . popular television series explore it , gliding over the cliffs by helicopter as if in a dream and coastal paths are never short of walkers . this suits barkham’s taste , because his childhood holidays were partly spent on scolt head island , off the emptiest part of the norfolk coast — an island with only one hut , where his parents chose to stay .
