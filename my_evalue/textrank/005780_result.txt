it seems to happen after every single world cup that someone near to the top of english cricket gets the sack . it is high time that we looked at the entire structure of english cricket and the reasons we are incapable of producing the types of cricketer required to succeed in international one-day cricket . i hate it when things become about one individual and believe me , everything that has gone wrong with english cricket has not been down to the handling of kevin pietersen ; however badly that has been done .
