a football club chairman has warned of a new breed of hooliganism in the sport â€“ from retired grandfathers who are trying to relive their youth and encourage violence on match days . he said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their ' gangs ' . our promotion to the football league appears to have encouraged our `` risk '' from the 1980s to come out of retirement . ' peter woor , a cambridge united fan , said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as southend united and luton town .
