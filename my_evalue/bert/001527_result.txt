joe anderson , 56 , the mayor of liverpool , claimed £4,500 per year from chesterfield high school , merseyside , despite doing nothing for pupils . mr anderson , who is paid an £80,000 salary , tried to sue the school ( pictured ) for discrimination after it stopped the payments , saying he was being punished for a ' philosophical belief ' in public service . mr anderson said that his claim was no about getting more money , but about protecting his lucrative public sector pension pot . a tribunal ruled that mr anderson was unfairly dismissed , but that it was '100 per cent likely ' the school would have sacked him following a consultation , so he was not entitled to compensation .
