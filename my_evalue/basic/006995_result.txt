carrying out the perfect u-turn can be tricky at the best of times , so spare a thought for this coach driver who had to complete it on a narrow river slipway . the coach driver found himself stuck on slipway , with a queue of cars behind , after he tried to board a ferry in devon only to get turned back . tourists and locals enjoying the sunshine at dartmouth gathered to watch as the coach , owned by french operator sovetours , was turned back when it tried to board the ferry on the kingswear side of the river dart .
