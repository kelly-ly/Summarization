bristol city will become the first football league club to win promotion this season should they beat bradford on tuesday night . it was important not to get beat here . if you look at it , if we had and then got nothing at bradford ( on tuesday ) then weâ€™re stuck on 88 points . cotterill , meanwhile , has always gunned for the league one title rather than just promotion and this result preserved their eight-point lead over preston , although they have played a game more .
