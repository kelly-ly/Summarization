mark wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived england suit . ‘ the horse will probably come with me to the caribbean if he gets through immigration . but as he showed in taking four australia a wickets in as many overs in a durham win at chester-le-street three years ago , he has the knack of getting good players out . the main thing he told me is that the stumps don’t move — we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in brisbane ( the first delivery of the 2006-07 ashes , which went straight to andrew flintoff at second slip ) — his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you’ll be fine after that . ’
