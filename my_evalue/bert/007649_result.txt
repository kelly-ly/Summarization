the first family has kicked off this year 's easter celebrations . the choir- including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties- sang a lively rendition of the hymn ' he lives , ' stirring most of the church , filled to capacity , to clap , sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering . the lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of christ . i owe him my life .
