what jason holder did in antigua and marlon samuels managed here will do much for the culture phil simmons is trying to create as new west indies coach . they will inspire their team-mates with their discipline , character and application , just as mike atherton inspired me with the way he batted to save a test in johannesburg and in his famous battle with allan donald at trent bridge . it is all well and good going off and having a bit of a hit and giggle but he will take a lot more satisfaction from the way he has taken on the moving ball in a demanding test match .
