if benny and bjorn actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song ( songwriters are not hot on facts – happy to say anything as long as it rhymes ) , they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the wellington museum in waterloo , just south of brussels in belgium . it is unfortunate for anniversary-celebrating purposes that waterloo lies in the french half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the battle of waterloo – with napoleon as the unchallenged star of the show . local anglo-belgian entrepreneur anthony martin has invested a substantial financial stake in plans for marking the anniversary by turning a templar hospice on the edge of the battlefield into a magnificent restaurant-cum-brewery ( where he brews waterloo beer , of course ) and a museum looking at the surgical side of the battle ( not for the squeamish ) .
