so while there were some loud , dirty guitars at the 2015 rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony in cleveland on saturday night , there was as much recognition for rock 's antecedents in soul and blues , speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that 's beyond words . fifty-one years earlier , starr had been in town to play the very same hall ; he admitted backstage that he did n't remember the cops stopping the show during `` all my loving '' and making the beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed . others receiving rock hall honors included paul butterfield blues band , early soul act the 5 royales , singer bill withers , punk rockers green day , lou reed , joan jett & the blackhearts and stevie ray vaughan .
