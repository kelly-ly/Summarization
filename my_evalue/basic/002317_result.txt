i am staying in the southwest of the island at mount cinnamon on grand anse beach , near the charming town of st george . i especially liked the beach cabana at mount cinnamon , where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night . the next day , i watch a fish cookery demonstration at mount cinnamon : a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut , ginger , lime , spices , peppers and chives , wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire , and served with delicious breadfruit chips .
