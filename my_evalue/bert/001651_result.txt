derby head coach steve mcclaren pointed an accusing finger at his own team after they let 10-man watford battle back to grab a 2-2 draw at the ipro stadium . derby had been in control until matej vydra fired them ahead in the 23rd minute after cyrus christie lost the ball out on the right but a mistake by ben watson just before half-time changed the game . we started to get negative and think the game was won and that 's the disappointment . ' it 's very frustrating for everyone but we only have ourselves to blame for not taking advantage and not winning that game and getting back in the race . '
