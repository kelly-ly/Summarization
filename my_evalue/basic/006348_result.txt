but it emerged yesterday that when andy murray and his new bride had their first dance on saturday night , judy murray was strictly on the sidelines . the former star of strictly come dancing – who frequently failed to impress the judges with her efforts – left the newlyweds to it as they took to the floor at their reception in cromlix house hotel , following their wedding at dunblane cathedral in the afternoon . after admitting to focusing more on her outfits following her appearance on strictly come dancing last year , mrs murray , 55 , broke with tradition on saturday by wearing a white coat , the same colour , as the stunning jenny packham gown worn by bride , kim sears .
