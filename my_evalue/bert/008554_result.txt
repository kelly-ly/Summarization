the uk is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer-stricken five-year-old ashya king made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment . the kings defiantly fled to spain in a bid to get ashya to the proton therapy centre in prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of nhs treatment . however , cancer research uk estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known . the nhs currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the united states for treatment .
