kabul , afghanistan ( cnn ) the flag is crude , handmade , but the message is clear -- allegiance to isis in afghanistan . wardak : mp shir wali wardak says : `` i do n't think isis fighters from syria and iraq have come here to afghanistan -- but hardcore taliban members who have understood that the taliban name is dying have changed the color of their flags from white to black in order to stay alive . there have been armed clashes between newly-converted isis ( members ) and taliban fighters ... who should be in control of certain places .
