spain 's 2-0 defeat by holland on tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 world cup , but coach vicente del bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat , insists gerard pique . holland , whose 5-1 drubbing of spain in the group stage in brazil last year marked the end of the iberian nation 's six-year domination of the world game , scored two early goals at the amsterdam arena and held on against some determined spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success . they became the first team to inflict two defeats on del bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental , second-string team .
