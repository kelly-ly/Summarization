when it launched eight years ago , cruise company azamara decided to make a name for itself , literally . famous for its salt pans , porto vecchio offered another treat - the azamazing evening ( there is one on every cruise ) , a large , free-of-charge party with masses of food , wine and entertainment laid on at a nearby beach that we reached in a fleet of coaches . i woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past positano .
