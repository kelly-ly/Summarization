surgeons have removed kidneys that each weighed as much as a newborn baby from an indian man with a genetic disorder . both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs ( 2.1kg ) , which was removed in dhule , india , in 2011 , according to guinness world records . although children are born with the condition , adpkd does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys ' functions . eventually , kidney function gets worse and worse , until so much is lost that kidney failure develops .
