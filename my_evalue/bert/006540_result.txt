alan stubbs hailed the bravery of his hibs players after they ruined hearts’ easter road title party with a 2-0 derby win . i don’t think people understood just how bad the injury was and the fact he is back playing now is all credit to him . my debut was special and i’ll always remember it but it was vital to get three points and keep the pressure on rangers . ‘ if we stay focused it could be a really good season for the club and the fans . ’
