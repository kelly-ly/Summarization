mary , 43 , treated her three youngest children , princess isabella , seven , and twins princess josephine and prince vincent , four , to a day out at a farm in kirke hyllinge , a village in zealand . making the most of the sunny weather , the quartet certainly appeared to be having fun , with all four crouching down to pet a tiny holstein friesian calf . the three children , meanwhile , were well-wrapped up in cosy padded jackets and appeared fascinated by the cows grazing in one of the barns , with prince vincent even climbing a fence to get a better look . going green : the moment came during eco day , an annual event in denmark .
