the family is now seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress . chronically ill in his final years , mr moon began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013 . the mistake is all the more surprising as mr moon was 72 and bald while mr petitclerc was 97 and had a full head of hair , the lawsuit said . the family , who had been given a bill of $ 8,834 by brown mortuary for the service , would only later learn that the mix up at the funeral home meant mr moon 's had been cremated .
