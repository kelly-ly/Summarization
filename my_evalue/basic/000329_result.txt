( cnn ) president abraham lincoln never lost his ardor for the united states to remain united during the civil war . `` with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right , '' he orated , `` let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations ' wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations . '' the spirit of lincoln 's second inaugural was self-evident on april 9 , 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when confederate gen. robert e. lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to union general ulysses s. grant at appomattox courthouse ( mclean house ) in virginia .
