trillions of pounds worth of oil – as much as the entire north sea fields – lies beneath an area of england dubbed ‘britain’s dallas’ , it was claimed yesterday . once oil has been found , oil companies pay the government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits . oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area , as well as gaining planning permission from the local council .
