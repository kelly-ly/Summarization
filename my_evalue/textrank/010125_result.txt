boy , are we doing well : snp leader nicola sturgeon campaigning in irvine , ayshire yesterday . yesterday she said : ‘ during the referendum campaign last year , we were told repeatedly by politicians who were trying to persuade scotland to vote no – and they succeeded – that scotland was an integral part of the uk , that our view mattered , ’ miss sturgeon said . ‘it’s completely unacceptable now for those politicians to say , when scotland is perhaps going to make its view heard by voting snp , to say your voice can’t be heard in the uk . ’
