a remote iron age fort built by the picts as a look out post on top of a 20-foot-high sea stack has been uncovered on the coast of scotland . the small fort was discovered on top of dunnicaer sea stack ( shown above ) and would have given the inhabitants a strong defensive position , although resupplying the fort up the cliff faces would have been hard . resupplying the fort when it was inhabited would have been a challenge . â€™ dunnicaer sea stack ( on the far left of the picture above ) is just quarter of a mile from dunnottar castle ( right ) .
