a size 24 woman who spent years gorging on discounted snacks on the supermarket she works at has lost seven stone after ditching the habit . leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight but the real problem began after starting her job in the co-op . i would tell myself that i was bringing it home so that the food would n't be wasted or would share it between my family but to be honest i would bring home food anyway whether it was cheap or not and it would all be for me . ' i have never felt so good and for once i can look in the mirror and feel happy at what i see - no more discounted goods for me . '
