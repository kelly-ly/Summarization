these are the pictures taken by an unforgiving regime of the men , women and children caught trying to escape its suffocating clutches and then forced to re-enact their ordeal for the cameras of the secret police . ' reenactment mfs ' - the ministry for state security better known as the ' stasi ' during the 40 year existence of the east german state - is a new book containing these photos of desperation which the socialist rulers used as evidence in the show trials against those they caught . hidden : these pictures were found in the archives of east germany 's stasi secret police , presumably the clothing of someone who had tried to flee the communist regime . simple : a picture of a ladder , which some desperate person had used to try to escape to the west .
