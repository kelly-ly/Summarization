josh meekings has been cleared to play in the scottish cup final after an sfa panel kicked out a charge of deliberate handball during sunday’s semi-final against celtic . that move created a furore - with jim boyce , fifa vice-president and head of the refereeing committee , warning that penalising meekings retrospectively would open up a can of worms for the game . there has been plenty happening since i came up here , going back to semi-final kick-off times , playing hearts ( in a semi-final ) at easter road in the middle of edinburgh , i just think sometimes inverness get treated with contempt . ’ i think there 's a wee bit more to it than what we are seeing .
