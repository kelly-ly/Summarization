tony mccoy gave a bumper crowd what they were hoping for as he steered jezki to a thumping victory in the grade one aintree hurdle . his task was made a little more straightforward than it might have been , as arctic fire – the favourite , ridden by ruby walsh – took a crashing fall at the final flight when poised to challenge jezki . i knew it was going to be a hard race and at the second last , i thought he might have me beat but 50 yards from the last hurdle , i was sticking in there . ‘ arctic fire takes a tumble at the final hurdle to allow jezki to take the lead and take the win at aintree .
