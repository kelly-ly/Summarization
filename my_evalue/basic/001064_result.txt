( cnn ) by some estimates , about a third of americans use some form of alternative medicine , including homeopathic remedies because they find western medicine inadequate . people who represent the industry , such as mark land , a member of the american association of homeopathic pharmacists , argue that the current fda system is a good one and that the products available today are of high quality and label standards are enough . while many people believe the drugs are safe in large part because they are highly diluted , products such as cold-eeze , if taken according to the recommendations on the label , would be 10 times the recommended dietary allowance ( rda ) of zinc for adult females and eight times the recommendation for males , according to fugh-berman .
