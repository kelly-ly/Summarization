referee mark clattenburg has been named to take charge of the manchester derby on sunday , despite having sent off three players from united and city this season . and , although clattenburg has been accused of favouring louis van gaal 's side in the past , it 's worth noting that the 40-year-old has only sent off two players season in the premier league this season and both have been from united ; tyler blackcett in the 5-3 defeat by leicester and luke shaw in the 1-1 draw with west ham . chelsea 1-1 manchester city . clattenburg has courted controversy during his career but is generally regarded as one of the premier league 's leading referees alongside michael oliver .
