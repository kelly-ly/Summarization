there are few things better than sipping a refreshing drink while admiring spectacular views of the sea and soaking up the sun at an island resort . holidaymakers with deep pockets can find that kind of privacy on a brazilian island which is tucked inside a picturesque bay and boasts chalets over the water , air-conditioned rooms to beat the sweltering heat , a heliport and a swimming pool carved into the rock – all from £2,500 ( $ 3,750 ) a night . while they have the tropical island all to themselves they will have access to a private , 100-ft beach protected from the open ocean on the stunning bay of angra dos reis . ilha de mana is a 15-minute boat ride from the town of paraty , and three hours by car or 40 minutes by helicopter from rio de janeiro .
