sally and stephen morley ( pictured with their daughter pixie ) are one of some 1,500 couples in britain who have had babies using embryoscope technology . professor simon fishel , who is boss of care fertility , the first clinic in britain to use the embryoscope , said : ‘ we now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things . ' and to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us . ’ professor fishel , who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby , louise brown , in 1978 , said the embryoscope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies .
