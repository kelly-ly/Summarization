an artist who turns dead animals into unique works of art has recently come under fire for his bizzare sculptures . while some religious folk have taken issue with the fact mr crawford is ' manipulating the animal ' by using animal parts in his work , he maintains that he’s only used parts that would have otherwise gone to waste . ‘ the bird is intact while the rabbit sculptures only feature half the animal with mr crawford expertly manipulating steel beams to make the sculpture whole . to be honest all of our clients have quite enjoyed it , people can be grossed out a bit but i think they are more interested in the end . ’
