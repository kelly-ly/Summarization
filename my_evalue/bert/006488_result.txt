manchester city defender pablo zabaleta accepts the fallen champions are facing a battle to finish in the top four . it is a far cry from the situation on new year 's day , when the defending champions pulled level with chelsea at the top with a 3-2 win over sunderland . sergio aguero was the rare highlight in an otherwise dismal manchester city performance at old trafford . but that was as good as it got as united equalised through the excellent ashley young and then took complete control .
