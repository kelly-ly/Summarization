a federal judge has sentenced former blackwater security guard nicholas slatten to life in prison for his role in a 2007 shooting that killed 14 iraqi civilians and wounded 17 others . u.s. district judge royce lamberth announced the sentences after a day-long hearing at which defense lawyers had argued for leniency , and prosecutors asked that those sentences - the minimums mandatory under the law - be made even harsher . the government sought sentences far beyond that , partly because it said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility .
