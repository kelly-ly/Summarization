a man dying of terminal cancer has decided not to check into the hospital but rather hit the streets as an uber driver . ken broskey , 69 , of livonia , michigan , has been diagnosed with stage 4 oropharyngeal cancer , and his doctors have urged him to check into hospice care . this so he can earn money to pay off his mortgage before he dies so his daughter and grandchildren ( above ) can have his house . this is all thanks to the work of roland gainer , a college student who started a campaign to help broskey after riding in the man 's car .
