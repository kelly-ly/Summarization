( allen lane £16.99 ) when , in 2002 , my family and i moved from busy north london to bucolic north herefordshire , we found that our new neighbours were , overwhelmingly , sheep . i didn’t want to be one of those townies who moves to the country but remains ignorant of rural ways , so i made sporadic efforts to get to know them , or at least , to get to understand life on a sheep farm . as rebanks makes abundantly clear — not least with his effusive praise for a famous children’s author , whom he thinks of not as the creator of peter rabbit , nor even as beatrix potter , but as mrs heelis , doughty champion of herdwick sheep — there is , between the two , all the difference in the world .
