the western lowland gorilla is an endangered species in the wild , but while exact numbers are not known because of their remote habitats , they are believed to be more common than mountain gorillas . lowland gorillas can be distinguished by their slightly brown coat and long arms , and usually live in communities of around 30 . thanks largely to disease and destruction of habitat , the numbers of western lowland gorillas living in the wild have dropped by 60 per cent in the last 20 to 25 years , making zoo conservation efforts all the more vital .
