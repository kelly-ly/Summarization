( cnn ) would you want a tv program about your family history to include details of a distant , long-deceased relative who had owned slaves ? apparently acquiesced to affleck 's request , because when the episode aired in october 2014 , there was no mention of the star 's slave-owning ancestor . now gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on affleck 's request , but it seems likely that he did . affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show .
