it has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of saigon as the north vietnamese army descended upon the city , and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety . ba van nguyen was able to fly a ch-47 chinook , the largest helicopter in the south vietnamese army , with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the south china sea where they were all ultimately saved by the uss kirk . saved : he flew towards the uss kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land , and so he hoovered over as his family ( daughter circled in red ) safely jumped out .
