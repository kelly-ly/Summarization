scientists have used cosmic rays from the distant universe to study lightning and thunderclouds in unprecedented detail . though they were discovered decades ago , cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare , making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated . this new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity . lightning ( shown in utah ) is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims victims around the world .
