fernando torres has played with some great players over the years but the on-loan atletico madrid striker regards steven gerrard as the best . torres spent three-and-half-seasons at the english club and struck up a close friendship with the former england captain , even returning to anfield to play in his charity match against jamie carragher 's side . since leaving the club in 2011 , torres has never quite found his best form - suffering a miserable time with chelsea before signing for ac milan and returning to atletico on loan .
