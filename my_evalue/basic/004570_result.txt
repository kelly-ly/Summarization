jeremy scott’s spring/summer 2015 collection for moschino caused an insta-stampede , nearly breaking the internet when he sent human barbie dolls down the catwalk . the creative head , who is famed for making kitsch cool , sent his models down the runway in milan in barbie doll inspired dresses to the sound of aqua 's iconic 90s hit , i 'm a barbie girl . so although donning jeremy scott’s barbie-inspired moschino collection wasn’t as much of an almighty leap for me as it would be for , say , the rest of the world , it still required a certain amount of chutzpah to take it to the streets .
