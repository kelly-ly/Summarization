‘ found this gold ring snorkelling at finns beach club in bali today ( april 7 ) . ’ the ring has what appears to be a family crest and has been engraved with the heartfelt message : ‘ darling joe , happy 70th birthday 2009 , love jenny’ . ‘ it would be great if all of you amazing people out there could ( share the picture of the ring ) and hopefully reunite this ring with its owners , joe or jenny asap.. !
