from 5pm sunday until almost the same time the next day , followers of the scooter 's facebook page were sent links such as this one , instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . after trying to contact officials at facebook with limited success , it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out , and regain control of the account . the hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through facebook itself . all of the images have now been removed , and scooter 's have offered apologies to thier customers via their facebook and twitter pages .
