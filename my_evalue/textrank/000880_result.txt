that 's what happened to gulnaz , who was barely 16 when she was raped . asadullah agreed to let us speak with him and gulnaz because , it seemed , he wanted to show us that things were now settled , that under afghanistan 's version of social morality he had done the right thing . it is truly chilling to see how things have gone for gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist , accepting a life as his second wife , trapped in his home .
