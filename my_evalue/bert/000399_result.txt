( cnn ) in case you needed a reminder that president barack obama is n't running for office again , he just alienated not only republicans , who have largely resented him from day one , but the progressive base of democratic voters . but according to a report by the new york times , clinton 's staff is at pains to suggest that clinton has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend . but now , as she campaigns for president facing a democratic electorate divided over the deal , clinton is sounding more critical . so does clinton support the tpp deal or not ?
