i’ve been out injured for a whole year now , but i’m finally on the verge of a return to regular training . james , pictured during a fashion shoot in manchester , has been sidelined for a whole year . but in reality , i never thought i’d be out for that long – i kept having setbacks after thinking i was about to return so i couldn’t stop and enjoy myself . i have learnt a lot about myself in the last year – both as an athlete and a person – and i believe the whole experience will benefit me in the long run .
