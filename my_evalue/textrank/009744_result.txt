tesco reduced the size of cartons of pasta sauce , such as tomato & mascarpone , from 375g to 350g yet the price remained the same and it was still promoted as serving two people . before christmas , burton’s reduced its £5 cadbury collection biscuits from 380g to 335g . in 2011 , cadbury reduced the size of the 140g bar of cadbury dairy milk to 120g , so losing the equivalent of two chunks . it then cut the size of its traditional circular roses tins from 975g to 850g – effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites .
