on saturday , rosetta swooped to within just 8.6 miles ( 14 km ) of comet 67p 's surface . after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet . as it becomes more active , rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data . the latest images include ones of earth and mars which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘ gravity assist manoeuvres’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet .
