over the past week or so i’ve been speaking to people who knew jimmy anderson in his early days . john stanworth , who was then lancashire’s player development manager , told me that coaches from other counties would pass comment on anderson’s idiosyncrasies , not least his habit of looking at his feet as he delivered the ball . peter moores deserves credit for allowing anderson to play his natural game when on england duty . for all the time and money invested at the national academy in loughborough , england’s best bowler has been at his most potent when he has done it his way .
