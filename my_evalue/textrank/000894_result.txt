the journey towards my family home in sifal was a map of quake destruction , with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart . meanwhile , the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of jhocchen , indra chowk , new road , and nearby neighborhoods . people gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads , on traffic islands and around metal pulpits , which looked out of range of falling buildings .
