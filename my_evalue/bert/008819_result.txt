modern humans have developed a reputation for being somewhat destructive and keen to separate themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom . the fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside neanderthal camps . they also found the fossilised bones of bonal tahr – a species of wild sheep that became extinct in western europe 100,000 years ago – which appear to have been hunted by the neanderthals . neanderthals , like the one above , may well have been the world 's first gourmet chefs and made jewellery .
