channel 4 's indian summers star olivia grant headed to phuket in thailand before the start of filming the second series . i was staying at the luxurious sri panwa resort , which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround-sound systems pumping out enya , and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering andaman sea . i’m sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel’s beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace , but when pim dropped me off at my villa , she revealed that another famous sri panwa guest – dj norman cook ( aka fatboy slim ) – was performing at a nightclub called seduction that evening .
