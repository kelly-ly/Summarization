dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims . one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle . the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together .
