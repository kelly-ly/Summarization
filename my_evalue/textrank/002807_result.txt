robert osborn , co-founding director of top luxury property developer consero london explained : ' home cinemas are a growing requirement , particularly for brand new or newly refurbished properties . ' ' at the high level , media rooms are a valuable use of space and are expected , particularly in homes priced above £10 million . we also often include pantries or bars as an addition to support the media room .

' ben estimates that cinemas can cost anything from a few thousand to £100,000 to kit out and says : ' home cinemas can vary from a converted surplus bedroom within an average sized dwelling to a 30-seater theatre in the basement of a much larger home .
