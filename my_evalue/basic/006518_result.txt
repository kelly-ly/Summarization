with a possible 11 games left to their season barcelona’s front three of leo messi , luis suarez and neymar are just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together . the three amigos will match the total scored by thierry henry , samuel eto’o and messi in 2009 if they reach 100 goals and they will inevitably fuel the debate that they are fast becoming the greatest front three in barcelona’s history . the henry/eto’o/messi forward line won the 2009 european cup and was followed two years later – after the failed attempt to bring zlatan ibrahimovic into the mix in 2010 – by the messi/david villa/pedro strike force that also won a european cup against manchester united in 2011 .
