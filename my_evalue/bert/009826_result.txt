manuel pellegrini should be given the chance to turn things around at manchester city next season , according to gary neville . and neville , talking at a budweiser dream goal event in regent 's park , believes keeping faith in pellegrini would bring some much-needed stability to the etihad stadium . ' he used the term `` garbage '' in recent weeks when discussing city 's form and four wins in 15 games for a club like man city is not right and i hope he stays to correct the performances and can complete the job . ' some of the football i have seen them play in that time has been the best and their players have been outstanding . '
