atletico madrid boss diego simeone believes english football needs to ‘ wake up’ after this season’s poor showing in europe . simeone , who takes atletico to rivals real madrid for a champions league quarter-final second leg on wednesday night , thinks this season’s failure should spark a response from the premier league’s top clubs . the fact that there is no english team left in the last eight of the champions league or in the europa league is a wake-up call for the premier league to look at why it is that , despite their great economic power and with all the many great footballers playing in england , chelsea are so far ahead of everyone else and why they have no teams left in europe .
