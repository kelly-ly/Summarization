trift suspension bridge -switzerland . it was supposed to connect hikers to a hut made inaccessible by a retreating glacier but it was known to swing wildly when windy and was only allowed to be crossed in summer months in clear weather . higher handrails and stabilizing cables were installed in 2009 but the bridge is still known to move in bad weather .
