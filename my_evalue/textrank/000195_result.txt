steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured , in much less than ideal circumstances . most of them have visible wounds : deep cuts , bruised faces , broken arms and legs or spinal injuries . little food , less optimism in kathmandu tent city .
