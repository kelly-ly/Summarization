however , sometimes during the course of an airline pilot 's career , or anyone 's career for that matter , stress issues may manifest as depression . as the world learns more about andreas lubitz , the co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525 , it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression . considering the hoops lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a germanwings co-pilot , it 's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed .
