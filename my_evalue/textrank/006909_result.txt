a first-half strike by the outstanding aaron ramsey was enough to see off burnley at an intimidating turf moor and record an eighth win in a row by arsene wenger 's side , the best run since the invincibles team managed it in 2004 . burnley 's kieran trippier ( left ) was unable to pull his side level with a 25-yard free-kick shortly after ramsey 's goal . he broke up most things but on the rare occasions he was breached , burnley fluffed their lines in front of goal .
