tony mccoy thanked the racing public for making the last two months of his career the most memorable of all as their appreciation helped him cope with the thought of retirement . the adulation shown to him has made the 20-times champion jockey realise just how much he affected the lives of the racing fraternity but while the decision to quit seemed to some to come out of the blue , mccoy feels he owes it to his family to go out at the top . i told all the lads yesterday to enjoy it while you 're doing it because the end comes quickly . ' i never felt like i did a day 's work in my life , i 've felt a lot of satisfaction and fulfilment and i 'm very proud of what i 've been lucky enough to achieve but so many people have helped that happen , i was just the lucky one who got on the best horse most of the time .
