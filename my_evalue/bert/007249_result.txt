on trial : former ukip mep ashley mote ( pictured arriving at london 's southwark crown court today ) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . between 2004 , when he was elected mep and 2009 , mote claimed a total of £750,000 in parliamentary assistance allowance , taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity . jurors heard that in light of this , mote wrote to the manager of european parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this . he said : ‘ what mr mote does n't say is something along the lines of “ i am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an mep” . ’
