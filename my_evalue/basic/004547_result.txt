the song can’t be identified and doesn’t fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale , raising hopes that it could be coming from a completely new species . experts are sure the noise isn’t made by arnoux 's beaked whales or cuvier 's beaked whales ( stock image ) , because the signal doesn’t match . but the song belong to a strap-toothed whale , a southern bottlenosed whale or a gray’s beaked whale ( pictured ) , according to the study , despite the sound being the wrong frequency for a gray’s beaked whale .
