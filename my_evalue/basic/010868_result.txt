master patissier eric lanlard is on-stage recalling how he once refused to bake a ' very rude ' cake for naomi campbell . ' as it happens , when hm toured the cruise ship britannia after the naming ceremony last month , one of the areas she was most impressed with was eric 's atrium-based market café , where the centrepiece is a beautiful , mouth-watering display : dainty , neon-hued raspberry macaroons , eton mess served with popping candy and chocolate salted caramel mille-feuilles . at a dinner hosted by eric in the cookery club , i watch my canard à l'orange being prepared on a screen while eric reels off anecdotes about baking one-ton cakes for sheikhs and having his bottom pinched by mary berry .
