this was as far away from the ashes cauldron as it is possible to be but a quiet day of run scoring against sub-standard opposition in picturesque basseterre at the start of england’s caribbean tour meant everything to jonathan trott . it must have seemed to trott that he would never again bat for england when he suffered that brutal dismantling at the hands of mitchell johnson during england’s ill-fated last ashes tour almost 18 months ago . neither cook nor trott could be blamed for that nor for the careful way they went about their batting in this two-day practice match against a st kitts invitational xi that would struggle to defeat a decent english club side .
