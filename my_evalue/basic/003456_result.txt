franck ribery has dismissed reports linking wolfsburg forward kevin de bruyne with bayern munich as a potential replacement for the former france international or his team-mate arjen robben . de bruyne , who spent his two years at chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed bundesliga club , has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league 's assist charts with 16 â€“ seven more than the next best . but ribery says despite his impressive form the 23-year-old belgian is the wrong style of player to come in under pep guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the holland winger .
