sending post to space is problematic , so when a teenager from houston , texas , wanted to send a message to her astronaut father , she had to be creative . the next time the nasa employee was up in space , she decided to create a huge art project in the desert that he would be able to see from the international space station . her father is a keen photographer and likes to take pictures of the earth when he is floating in space .
