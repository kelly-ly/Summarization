late-sleeping lilly pulitzer fans found out the hard way that if you snooze , you lose - literally - when target 's complete stock of lilly pulitzer merchandise sold out almost immediately early sunday morning . now officially sold out by the retailer , pieces from the diffusion line have popped up on ebay - but those cruising the bidding site should n't expect to see the same original low prices paid by target customers . however , within 24 hours , many more sold-out items became available on ebay for under $ 100 , including a $ 9.99 makeup bag that sold for $ 19.99 and a $ 15 headband that sold for $ 30 . but though frustrated fans criticized target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies , these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store 's past designer collaborations .
