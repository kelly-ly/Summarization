steve clarke sprang up and pumped the air with his fist . they backed off and defended , and offered a little too much respect to the team with the best form in the barclays premier league since the turn of the year . ozil and sanchez swaggered down the tunnel for the start of the second-half , deep in conversation , planning more damage but reading stirred , found an equaliser and were able to add urgency to their game . he will have been disappointed with the first-half display but hugely proud of their response and the desire they showed .
