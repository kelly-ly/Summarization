she invited several other women , including complete newbies , through the soletri sisters facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes , bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes . i was lucky enough to connect with the major taylor cycling club of chicago ( mtc3 ) for a series of novice rides they 've been hosting on local trails around chicagoland . riding outside with the wind whipping your face , chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and i 'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors .
