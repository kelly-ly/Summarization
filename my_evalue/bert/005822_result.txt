the french state railway company on monday demanded police action against ' irresponsible ' paris-roubaix cycle race riders who breached a safety barrier seconds before a high speed train hurtled by . the sncf company made an official complaint to french prosecutors saying the action in sunday 's prestigious race had risked a deadly tragedy . the last of the riders went through the barrier in northern france about eight seconds before the tgv train arrived at the waller crossing , 87 kilometers ( 54 miles ) from the end of the so called ' hell of the north ' race . race officials slowed the leading riders so that those held up by the barrier could catch up .
