fashion designer alannah hill is the least likely candidate for skin cancer as she prides herself on her alabaster skin - even going to the extremes of wearing gloves and using a parasol to protect her from the sun . hill had no intention of going public about her shocking story until her doctor encouraged her to speak out to educate others on the disease that affects almost half a million people every year in australia . hill has had part of her toe removed and a skin graft from her inner thigh and then after about a week doctors will decide if she needs anymore treatment .
