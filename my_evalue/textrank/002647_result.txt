' as the location of mayfairâ€™s dairy , the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site , without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls . ' the result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic mayfair . '
