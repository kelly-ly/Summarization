a 63-year-old former air hostess has won a £14.5m london mansion from her ' immensely wealthy ' 90-year-old saudi arabian ex-husband following a legal battle based on a victorian law . but the judge refused to grant the woman the £205,014 she was seeking annually to spend on jewellery , handbags and cars . but the judge rejected the claim that he would have promised to transfer his wife any properties for any other reason than tax , insisting he was still the ' beneficial owner ' of the property . i can not conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property .
