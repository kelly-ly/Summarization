( cnn ) in the beginning ... there was the bible , and it was a very good book . at work this week , i was talking with some colleagues about pope francis ' upcoming trip to the united states . later , when i graduated , my grandparents gave me a beautiful bible that has traveled with me from vermont to montreal to atlanta and finally to washington . i figured that no one would care about my thoughts or my process .
