bayern 's shock 3-1 defeat by porto may not have gone down well in munich but in manchester – the blue half at least – it will have been a different story . 2002–2003 : roma ( 4 , 0 ) . the 44-year-old 's early record in the competition is stunning , lifting the trophy two times in three years - although he will not inherit a team featuring the likes of xavi , andres iniesta and lionel messi in manchester . at the nou camp he showed the likes of samuel eto'o , zlatan ibrahimovic and none other than a certain yaya toure the door .
