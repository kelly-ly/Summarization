manchester united have been brilliant in the second half of the season but the defeat at everton was a timely reminder that they still have a long way to go . recently i wrote about what united need to take them back to a proper challenge for domestic and european glory . i ca n't see how everton score that first goal if carrick is on the pitch . there is a way any manchester united team must play â€“ david moyes found that out to his cost , and earlier this season van gaal listened to the fans ' loud and clear disapproval of negative football and passes going backwards too often and changed the way they played .
