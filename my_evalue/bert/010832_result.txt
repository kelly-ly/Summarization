genealogists have made an error in compiling the family tree of hillary clinton and she is in fact linked to a poor welsh mining family , an expert claimed . hannah jones rodham , frequently described by mrs clinton as a ' strong willed woman ' gave birth to mrs clinton 's father hugh e rodham in 1911 and died in 1952 when mrs clinton was just five . he had been born in northumberland and travelled to america with his family where he met hannah jones . she was later forced to correct the error after it was proven that hannah jones was born in the us in the 1880s .
