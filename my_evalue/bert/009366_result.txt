bulgarians love their traditional music . on the way down , we walked past fields of potatoes – the staple diet in the mountains – and through muslim villages , a legacy of the ottoman empire . it was easy to see why folklore survived in these places as they are so cut off from the outside world . next morning , things became more difficult as the locals use the cyrillic alphabet which i found impenetrable , so i couldn’t read the destination on the bus timetable .
