you get the impression around english cricket at the moment that people have a bit of a downer on stuart broad . he has an ability to come up with that magic spell , one that changes the whole course of a match as we have seen him do in big ashes tests . you can imagine what the aussies felt when they heard an englishman saying he was having nightmares about the short ball . what he needs to do now is sit down with a recording of that century at lordâ€™s five years ago and watch every single ball to see what he did then .
