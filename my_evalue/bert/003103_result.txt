on friday night i’ll be wearing bath’s no 6 shirt for the second time in a premiership game . the switch from midfield has worked for myself and the team , so i’m hoping i can carry on playing in the back row for the rest of this season . it was a great experience to spend time with the england squad . he told me i wouldn’t be part of those six nations matches , but he was very happy with how i’m going .
