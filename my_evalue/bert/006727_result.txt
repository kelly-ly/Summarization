a kitten which miraculously survived a seven-storey fall is on the road to recovery after it was found lying on the ground covered in maggots and blood . once it was taken to the vet by a passer-by , doctors found maggots in its mouth while also discovering that the cat had injuries including a broken jaw , broken leg , broken hard palate and bruised lungs . seven was first introduced to the public in march when my vet animal hospital posted a desperate call out to its owner . for seven , the vet clinic has been his temporary home for the last month where he is slowly learning to walk again .
