i see usain bolt on the circuit and heâ€™s always good fun . i remember in moscow , at the last world championships , when i was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner , he killed me in the warmup . adam gemili says usain bolt is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice .
