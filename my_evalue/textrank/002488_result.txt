physicists at cern , the geneva-based organisation which runs the lhc , are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device 's upgrade . now the physicists operating the machine have their sights on dark matter , the invisible , undetectable material that makes up 84 per cent of matter in the universe and binds galaxies together yet whose nature is unknown . the lhc might be able to produce dark matter particles for example , which would be glimpsed in the debris of collisions detected by the atlas and cms experiments . ' even more exciting is the possibility that the universe could have more than three space dimensions , and that other spaces are hidden all around us . '
