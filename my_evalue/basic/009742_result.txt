one of them belongs to their old nemesis samuels who , along with the obdurate kraigg brathwaite , saw west indies into credit and within sight of another draw with only the final test in barbados next week to play . alastair cook brought stokes back when samuels arrived at the fall of west indiesâ€™ second wicket , but his four-over burst failed to earn a breakthrough . west indies ended this fourth day on 202 for two , a lead of 37 , with brathwaite unbeaten on 101 , and the only winner on day five looks likely to be the lifeless pitch unless england make big inroads with the second new ball .
