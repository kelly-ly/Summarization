a controversial anti-vaccination organisation has come under fire for comparing compulsory vaccination to rape in a social media post . the australian vaccination skeptics network , an anti-vaccinations lobby group , posted an image to their facebook page on thursday which shows a man holding a woman with his hand over her mouth in an aggressive silencing gesture . the image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by social services minister scott morrison earlier in april , which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons .
