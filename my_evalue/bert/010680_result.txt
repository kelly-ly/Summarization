this is the incredible moment a man narrowly missed being burnt alive by a massive fireball which erupted from the pavement . father-of-two shiraz nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he had walked over it in a busy street in the west midlands . the flames kept shooting up - maybe five or six times . i 'm a building contractor so i knew that when i heard the noises it was something to do with electrics .
