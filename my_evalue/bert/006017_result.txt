there are moments when falcao sets off on those delayed runs in the bright red shirt of manchester united and it all comes flooding back . it is sad to say but the knee injury he suffered in the build up to last summerâ€™s world cup , when he gamely tried to recover in time to play for colombia , has cost him that critical yard of pace . terry was on top of him , taking the responsibility for marking the united forward away from his central defensive partner gary cahill for large sections of this clash . falcao is indifferent , short of confidence ( and goals ) after a frustrating eight months since his move on loan from monaco for the season was confirmed .
