former leeds and england coach tony smith admits he was shocked by kevin sinfield 's decision to switch codes but , on reflection , believes it could be an inspired decision . sinfield , who is closing in on third place in rugby league 's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points , told a news conference at headingley he did not want to play against rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead carnegie 's bid for a premiership return was too good to resist . it 's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues . ' i 'm very respectful of the game and i like watching it .
