the results of the obama white house 's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical islam in the middle east , north africa and south asia . given the frightfully slow pace america 's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both isis and its progenitor , al qaeda , the picture of what 's in store is clear : the body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas . soon after clapper acknowledged al qaeda was not a band on the run , as president obama had described the terrorist enterprise , a report by terrorism expert seth jones of the rand corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the white house : as restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like libya , tunisia and egypt during the arab spring , those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al qaeda and groups aligned with it .
