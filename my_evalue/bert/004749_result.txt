it has been at the root of division and persecution for centuries , but it seems that the white skin of most modern europeans did not evolve in europe at all . around 5,800 years ago the second gene , which makes skin colour lighter still , also began to spread though the european population . farmers at this time travelled north , bringing new technology and language into europe . but from ancient dna it now looks like the first farmers in mainland europe were still relatively dark-skinned and dark-eyed , and lacked the ability to digest milk properly until only about 4,000 years ago , while contemporary hunter-gatherers in scandinavia may have been lighter-skinned but with a surprising frequency of a gene found in oriental populations today , suggesting they would have resembled them in hair form and the distinctive morphology of their front teeth .
