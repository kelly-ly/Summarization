this new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion tuesday at howard university 's college of medicine . `` there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home , so we 've got to do better in protecting vulnerable americans , '' obama continued . `` communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively , and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change , '' said obama .
