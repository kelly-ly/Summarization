eden hazard has been the best player in the premier league all season and on saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to chelsea’s imminent title victory . he did it last week at queens park rangers , winning the ball from the goalkeeper’s kick and driving into the box to set up cesc fabregas , and he did it on saturday with his finish . you wondered when jose mourinho came in whether hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him .
