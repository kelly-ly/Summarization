online blogging sensation zoella has come under fire from jamie oliver 's company over adverts for unhealthy foods that appear next to her vlogs on youtube . internet star zoella , real name zoe elizabeth sugg , has enjoyed meteoric success after her blog and video posts amassed a huge teen following on social media . oliver 's own company says it has a deal with youtube that ensures that the chef 's channel on the video sharing website actively stops sugary food and drinks from being promoted next to his videos . the vloggers are unlikely to have control over which adverts appear next to their posts although oliver 's company is suggesting that such influential stars should be proactive in requesting that certain brands , such as haribo and coca cola , do not appear .
