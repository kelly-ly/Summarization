jose mourinho had placed the barclays premier league’s joint-top goalscorer on standby for this match , insisting he would only turn to diego costa if absolutely necessary . chelsea gave away possession in the final third – not for the first time – and a frowning mourinho turned to his substitutes’ bench , gestured at costa with a nod , and the striker began warming up down the touchline . never in doubt , as no player in premier league history has taken more and never missed than hazard . as stoke found out , remy can fill the gap left by costa , and hazard is simply every bit a premier league title winner in the making .
