los angeles ( cnn ) former rap mogul marion `` suge '' knight was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic `` straight outta compton '' earlier this year . at the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom . the survivor is cle sloan , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify knight as his attacker because sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends knight to prison , according to cnn affiliates kabc and ktla . at the time , knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case .
