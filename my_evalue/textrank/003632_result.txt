home kit ( 1983-1985 ) liverpool 's golden age in the 1980s meant we could have picked from a number of kits but the strip worn against roma in the 1984 european cup final win gets our vote for its iconic status . crown paints did not feature on the shirt in that year 's european cup final . home kit ( 1995-1996 ) a 1996 title fight just was n't quite in reach for liverpool in the end , but their adidas strip from that year has found its place in history after being involved in of the premier league 's greatest ever games in the 4-3 win over newcastle . sure enough liverpool looked smart on all fronts in their yellow strip when they came from behind to defeat arsenal in the 2001 fa cup final , with the season also seeing the reds win the league cup and uefa cup .
