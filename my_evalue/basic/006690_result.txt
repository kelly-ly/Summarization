i conducted a poll on my radio show recently , and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe manchester united will win the title next season . manchester united boss louis van gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by chelsea . obviously van gaal can not win the same number of trophies sir alex picked up during his 27 year reign , so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at united ?
