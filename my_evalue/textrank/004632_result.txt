scenes like these will be repeated across australia on anzac day this saturday , heaving crowds of punters betting on the toss of coins in games of two up . the martingale betting strategy of doubling up originated in france and is used with levels of success by punters on anzac day throughout australia . mr deguara offered a similar warning : ' before you run off to the atm to load yourself up in readiness for a double-up day of two-up , remember that the perception of guaranteed success that punters have about the double-up approach is not entirely accurate . ' ' the only way that it can guarantee a win is if you have an infinite amount of cash and an infinite number of coin tosses , neither of which are available to punters tomorrow . '
