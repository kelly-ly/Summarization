overall i’m sure miliband’s coaching team will be patting themselves on the back and declaring a win but his gesticulation and approach looked as manicured and choreographed as a torville and dean routine . nicola sturgeon ( pictured ) is a smiling assassin , making her a tricky opponent for cameron to stand next to . farage ( left and right ) was diminished during this debate , perhaps the only casualty of the night , and it was the women who finally took him down with a few small swats .
