dear lord hall , my jeans are too tight , my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years , my friends are all incredibly right-wing and i’ve got hog-whimperingly drunk in the presence of david cameron on more than one occasion . i like the small , nippy ones with exciting turning circles . every year , when the time came to make the pilgrimage home to britain to visit relatives , my parents would take turns driving , never stopping ( they didn’t want to have to pay for a hotel room ) , as we children sat in the back eating our way through the vast supply of my mother’s tiny chicken sandwiches . aka mrs toad ) ps .
