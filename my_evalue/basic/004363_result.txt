but what appears to be the final resting place of childhood toys is , in fact , a hospital where dolls in need of repair are given a new lease of life . the hospital of dolls , or ospedale delle bambole as it is known in rome , was built by the squatriti family 60 years ago and today their descendants , federico squatriti , 52 , and his 82-year-old mother gelsomina continue the family tradition . creepy : hundreds of disembodied dolls and decapitated heads are piled up on the shelves of the shop , where they are given a new lease of life .
