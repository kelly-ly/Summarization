some of the oldest surviving photographs of the houses of parliament and windsor castle , dating back more than 150 years , have been found . while a picture taken from the banks of the thames of windsor castle , showing prout 's floating dark room in the foreground , is remarkably similar to contemporary pictures of the iconic building . but most of the photos show how little things have changed - such as the photos of the houses of parliament and marlow lock . the images capture how london 's landmarks appeared in the nineteenth century , such as at great marlow lock , as he travelled past .
