online fitness company protein world caused a twitter storm recently with its london underground poster of a genetically-blessed model in a small yellow bikini , asking : ' are you beach body ready ? ' the original poster , from protein world , has been subject to much controversy , with many citing it as 'body-shaming ' the spoof advert follows the same striking format as the protein world original , with an eye-catching yellow background and bold font , and is marked up as a dove product ( dove 's real beauty campaign encourages women to appreciate their bodies , regardless of size and shape ) but the brand have denied being involved . after being made aware of the copycat image a representative for dove said : the ad was not created by dove but we do believe that every woman is beach body ready !
