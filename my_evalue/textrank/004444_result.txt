the duo compared the number of ' neighbours ' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells , according to the study published in ecological complexity . they used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls . the majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six ' neighbours ' , and similar percentages of other neighbours ( shown in this graph ) .
