district court judge kenneth marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- `` jane doe 3 and jane doe 4 '' -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with epstein without consulting them . marra wrote in the decision that the `` lurid details '' of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit . according to the filing , `` epstein required jane doe # 3 to have sexual relations with dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor , not only in florida but also on private planes , in new york , new mexico , and the u.s. virgin islands . '' `` never under any circumstance have i ever had any sexual contact of any kind , which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever , with jane doe # 3 , '' he said .
