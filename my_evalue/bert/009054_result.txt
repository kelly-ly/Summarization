the new horizons spacecraft has taken its first colour image of pluto and its largest moon charon ahead of its arrival in three months . our best images of pluto so far come from the hubble space telescope ( shown is one of the images ) , so the arrival of new horizons is hugely exciting for scientists , who have waited many years to catch a glimpse of this distant world and unravel some of its secrets . scientific literature is filled with papers on the characteristics of pluto and its moons from ground based and earth orbiting space observations , but we’ve never studied pluto up close and personal , ’ said john grunsfeld , nasa science mission directorate . ‘ that targeting is critical , since the computer commands that will orient the spacecraft and point its science instruments are based on knowing the exact time and location that new horizons passes pluto .
