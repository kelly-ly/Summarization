lucian faggiano 's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history , including vast rooms and pottery ( shown in this image that features mr faggiano left and his son ) . in a bid to stop the sewage backing up , mr faggiano , 60 , and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 via ascanio grandi , the new york times reported . eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant , the building has been turned into museum faggiano ( pictured ) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family .
