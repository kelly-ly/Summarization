a liberal democrat candidate has thanked nick clegg for not visiting his seat because he said it would turn off voters . after the interview , the lib dems issued a 121 word statement on mr mason 's behalf praising mr clegg for having ' real guts ' . the statement said : ' nick has shown real guts as our party leader and is someone i admire and respect . ' as deputy prime minister he delivered tax cuts for low earners , more jobs and apprenticeships , and ensured real investment has come to redcar after decades of neglect by labour and the tories . ' whilst this real difference to real peopleâ€™s lives has not always been given a fair hearing in the mainstream political circuit , the election campaign at last gives nick and our party a chance to be heard directly by the public . ' as such i have no doubt that if nick now came to redcar and met all the people who have benefited from having the liberal democrats in government he would be well received . '
