( cnn ) bernie sanders , my vermont senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president . let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely ( and with admiration ) for a long time : when people stop to listen to bernie , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear . he served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of lake champlain with remarkable energy for many years , listening closely to what people had to say , learning about politics at the local level , making a real difference in the daily lives of hard-working people .
