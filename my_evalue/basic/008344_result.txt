the son of a syrian imam who was shot dead on a london street may have met his father’s killer just days before the murder . sources close to the investigation , which is being led by the counter-terrorism unit , told the sunday times that abdul hadi arwani , an opponent of syrian president bahsar al-assad , had visited the area where he was killed with his son days before his death . one syrian opposition activist has said despite arwami’s standing and his participation in protests against the assad regime in london in 2012 ( pictured ) the imam was an unlikely target for assassination .
