bearing in mind heâ€™s a dog , don the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway . like a scene from wallace and gromit , the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank , on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier . behind the wheel : don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the m74 near abington in south lanarkshire during rush hour .
