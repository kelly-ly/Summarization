but northern irishman boyce , who is also chairman of fifa’s referees committee , believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee steven mclean and his assistants . ‘ the only punishment , if any punishment at all is due , should be made if the scottish fa feel the officials in charge of this game acted improperly and made the wrong decision . ’ fifa 's head of referees jim boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong . ‘ but if steven mclean had seen it at the time , he’d have been sent off and he’d be missing the final had inverness gone on to win ; and if he ( meekings ) hadn’t done it , celtic would have scored and there’s a good chance they would have gone on to win , so again josh meekings would have missed the final .
