australians have taken to social media to remember the sacrifice of the anzacs , as record numbers gathered at dawn services across the country to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the gallipoli landing . proud aussies came together in huge numbers in sydney , while more paid their respects in queensland 's regional and coastal towns of gympie and coolangatta . large groups gathered elsewhere around the country , with the nation 's capital canberra in particular focus as many gathered in the dark outside the australian war memorial and spilling out far beyond the usual ceremonial area .
