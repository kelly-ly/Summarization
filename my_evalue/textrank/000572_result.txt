decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well : more anxiety ( that ca n't be good for your health ) , more procedures ( which often involve needles , pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs ) and more treatment for `` disease '' not destined to cause problems ( as in over a million additional american men treated for prostate cancer , ditto women for breast cancer ) . now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch , soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app . they are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer .
