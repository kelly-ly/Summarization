sir alex ferguson , the quiet years . the 73-year-old , who had lived and breathed football since making his senior debut at the age of just 16 , was famous not just for the trophies won – his haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily britain’s most successful ever manager – but the hours put in . football is no longer the dominant factor in his life , with even questions on the game receiving short shrift , although – and this wasn’t always the case back in his managerial days - he was very polite in his refusal , answering the one out-of-bounds query by saying : listen , aberdeen are doing fantastic . there is that great photo of all the housewives in govan standing outside the close ; that rent men was never getting in that close .
