christopher stefanoni , a 50-year-old from darien , a town of 21,000 with a median household income of $ 200,000 , says his nine-year old was kicked off his team and put in a lower-ranking one just after he proposed developments involving affordable housing . connecticut governor dannel malloy has called affordable housing one of the state 's most pressing needs and has committed hundreds of millions of dollars for more affordable housing . in 2010 , darien won a four-year exemption to a state law making it easier for developers to build in towns with less than 10 percent affordable housing and town officials expect to win another after resolving a dispute with the state . darien first selectman jayme stevenson said the town has made significant efforts to increase affordable housing and its housing practices are n't discriminatory .
