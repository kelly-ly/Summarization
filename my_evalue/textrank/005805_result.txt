cook ( right , pictured with gary ballance ) and his team-mates are preparing for england 's second test . the second test that starts here is not exactly make or break for cook but he needs runs and a victory as much as at any time in a career that has seen him score more test centuries than any other englishman . the decision of graves and harrison to sack paul downton as managing director and announce that they are looking for a new ‘supremo’ to replace him has placed cook and peter moores under more pressure than ever . by definition , the new powers at the ecb can not have been happy about the big decisions downton made in a traumatic 14 months and few were bigger than the move to bring back moores as coach and the continued backing of cook .
