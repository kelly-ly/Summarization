england can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here . the whole of england’s bowling psyche is about containment , it’s about bowling maidens and building pressure , as we saw for much of the first day here in grenada until west indies started to crack . england have a good spinner in moeen ali - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back-up in joe root .
