former virginia first lady maureen mcdonnell who has been found guilty of corruption now says she did not receive a fair trial . maureen mcdonnell was a onetime washington redskins cheerleader who was known for her work with military families . lawyers for both bob mcdonnell and his wife argued in separate briefs that the favors he did for williams did not amount to ' official acts ' covered by federal bribery law . according to maureen mcdonnell 's appeal , judge spencer gave the jury an overly broad definition of ' official act , ' and in what her lawyers described as an ' orwellian moment , ' the prosecution extended it to the governor 's wife to prove conspiracy between the spouses , even though she was never a government official , reported the richmond times-dispatch .
