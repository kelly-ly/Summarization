v.stiviano , the alleged mistress of clippers owner donald sterling , who he showered with expensive gifts , has been ordered to pay his wife $ 2.6million . shelly sterling has been awarded nearly all of the $ 3 million she had sought to be returned from v. stiviano , who had argued that the gifts were made when donald sterling was separated from his wife . while an accountant for sterling conservatively estimated that stiviano got more than $ 3.6 million in sterling gifts that included a ferrari and paris shopping spree , o'donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $ 1 million in cash , saying the lower figure lined up with stiviano 's own admissions on the witness stand , depositions and court filings .
