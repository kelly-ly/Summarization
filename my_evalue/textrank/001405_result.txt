right now itâ€™s kane but sturridge and welbeck certainly offer good alternatives . rooney is picked in this team in a central role while sturridge gets the nod ahead of young pretenders such as harry kane simply on the back of experience . it 's perhaps harsh on daniel sturridge , who has proven his effectiveness over greater time , but how can anyone currently bet against kane ?
