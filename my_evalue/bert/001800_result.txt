our young earth may have collided with a body similar to the planet mercury , says a new paper . and it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in earth’s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet’s other building blocks - meteorites . the object would have been the heat source for our planet 's core . perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the earth and then later condensed to form the moon .
