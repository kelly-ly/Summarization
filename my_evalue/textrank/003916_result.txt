education is a sore point for many who backed the lib dems in 2010 on the promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then saw them trebled to £9,000 per year . but mr clegg will claim the lib dems are now ‘ the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges . the money would be spent on qualified teachers in every classroom , training more teachers , more classes in small groups or one to one and expanding early years education .
