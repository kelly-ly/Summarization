do n't play h-o-r-s-e with this guy ... lebron james has been able to do just about anything he wants during his team 's first three playoff games this season and that has apparently carried over to practice as well . after he wound up for the shot ( left ) , james flicked it overhand ( right ) while his teammates watched him shoot . in 13 career postseason games in boston , james is averaging about 29 points , nine rebounds , and six assists . apparently superman - howard 's nickname - is just as powerful as the king .
