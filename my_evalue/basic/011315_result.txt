defiant stuart mccall on thursday night urged rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure and maintain belief in their promotion push . the ibrox side crashed to a second championship defeat of the season at palmerston as derek lyle , gavin reilly and a lee wallace own goal gave queen of the south’s play-off hopes a massive boost . but mccall is adamant that confidence will not be dented by the scale of the loss and he expects his players to bounce back in sunday’s home meeting with raith rovers .
