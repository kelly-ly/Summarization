how could it be that a vastly- experienced and hugely-respected surgeon with a track record for rescuing stellar careers imperilled by injury failed to meet guardiola 's requirements as club doctor ? he claims that a substance called hyalart , which is extracted from the crest of cockerels , helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain . it placed club bosses in a quandary , not for the last time , as muller-wohlfahrt pointed out he had a steady stream of high-profile patients to his city centre practice , not least the likes of usain bolt , and that he could ill-afford to desert his post to spend day after day at the club 's training facility . irked by muller-wohlfahrt 's defiance , it soon became apparent to guardiola that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury .
