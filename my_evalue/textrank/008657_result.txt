a muslim cleric has issued a fatwa ordering a woman to agree to sex with her husband even if they are on the back of a camel , as he denounces the idea of marital rape as ' made up by european people ' . outrageous : perak mufti tan sri harussani zakaria said women should never say no to their husbands - and claimed marital rape was ' made up ' by europeans , so there was no need for muslims to take any notice . we need to recognise that women , both married and not married , have the right over their own bodies , and that includes the right to reject sex . ' to turn a blind eye to that right is to reduce the womanâ€™s dignity as a person and to further normalise the prevalence of sexual crimes in our society . '
