sky and bt sports pay Â£16million a year for live coverage of scottish football . st mirren facing ross county on a wet march night in paisley will never be a rival to the manchester derby but broadcasters do n't show scottish football out of charity . scottish football like a pavement beggar . on saturday , hibernian and falkirk fans will be asked to travel to glasgow for a scottish cup semi-final which kicks off at 12.15pm why ? because sky sports want the game out of the way to show a recorded documentary on bob paisley .
