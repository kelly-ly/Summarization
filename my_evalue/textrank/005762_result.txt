only once during the course of an exclusive interview with sporstmail does quillin speak with a hint of bite to match the aggression that saw him put hassan n’dam n’jikam on the canvas six times en route to his 2012 world-title win . while lee is the defending champion next weekend , quillin , the challenger , is also the former title holder having never lost the belt in the ring . lee later stepped in to defeat the russian ( for a much lower purse ) , leaving quillin to face accusations of ‘ducking’ his obligations as champion .
