sam burgess has been selected in the back row as bath seek to bounce back from the end of their european dream by defeating newcastle on friday night . burgess was called into england 's rbs 6 nations squad to step-up his education in the new code , although he was never considered for selection by the red rose who regard him as an inside centre . the 26-year-old 's slow progress since departing the south sydney rabbitohs has led to speculation he may return to league , but jason robinson is among those who believe he can still win a place in england 's world cup squad .
