chelsea manager jose mourinho said he was unfazed by his side 's staggeringly low possession stat during the 1-0 win over manchester united and all that mattered to him was achieving a positive result . mourinho , though , insisted that his team 's priority was to win the game and not concern themselves with statistics . they could have 99 ( per cent ) . with chelsea 's last seven league victories all coming by a single goal margin , it would be hard to argue mourinho is anything but sincere .
