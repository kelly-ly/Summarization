when high-energy electrons and ions from the sun hit earthâ€™s upper atmosphere , they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras . the accelerator would be located in space , 185 miles ( 300km ) above the ground , and would fire back towards earth 's atmosphere . it was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance .
