picture the scene : you come home after work feeling too exhausted to cook - only to find a delicious meal worthy of a michelin-starred restaurant waiting for you . it sounds like a fantasy , but it could be about to come true thanks to a robot chef developed by british scientists . according to its creators , the arms can chop , stir , whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat , whether it is a simple home-cooked supper , or an elaborate concoction designed by a world-class chef . by that point , they claim , users will be able to order meals from an itunes-style library of recipes devised by professional chefs , making it possible to tuck into michelin-standard food on a daily basis .
