adam netted one of the most memorable goals in premier league history as he lobbed chelsea goalkeeper thibaut courtois from 66 yards on the stroke of half-time . and while adam was understandably proud of his ' incredible ' goal , the scotland international admits the main thing for him is how the team get on and he was quick to turn his focus to next weekend 's clash with west ham . it 's three on the bounce we 've lost now , which is bad , but hopefully we can improve on that next week against west ham . ' on an individual level it 's great , but on a team performance it was ok and there 's a lot that we can improve on for next week . '
