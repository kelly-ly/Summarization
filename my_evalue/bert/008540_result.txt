kevin pietersen has lashed out at graham gooch for commenting on his attempted england comeback . gooch , the former england captain who also worked as the national side 's batting coach until last year , went as far as saying pietersen had ' wiped the floor with the ecb ' in the lengthy pr battle since his sacking in 2014 . he retweeted a bbc online article and then posted a brief but pointed attack on gooch , relating to his captaincy on the 1982 rebel tour of apartheid-era south africa . coach peter moores was less ambiguous .
