an artist with a surreal take on the natural world uses photoshop to create whimsical , mind-bending pictures that would give salvador dali a run for his money . a picture called ' bring home nature , bring home joy , features a man riding a bicycle with a whole tree in his bike 's basket , which sheds leaves against the setting sun . a man installs a mural of the sea in the middle of the desert , creating an idyllic beach view . and a scene of hot air balloons floating over green fields and hills is not all it seems , formed of red onion ' ballons ' , broccoli floret ' trees ' and potato ' hills ' .
