in the space of 10 minutes on monday , the hibs boss did placatory – ‘ i have a lot of respect for peter and what he’s done’ – and followed it with accusatory , as in ‘ i think you need to ask peter what he said when he came into my office after we got beat 1-0 in the first game ; it certainly was not what he said in the press ( on saturday ) . ’ hibernian manager alan stubbs did not know what to make of peter houston 's recent post-match comments . however you choose to interpret everything stubbs said both on saturday *and* after reading houston’s sharp response , a lot of people will be watching their next meeting – falkirk host hibs on the last day of the championship season , inevitably enough – for signs of enmity .
