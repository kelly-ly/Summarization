survivors from the boat , made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities , have now claimed the men tried to throw other christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain . a christian migrant told how he and others formed a ' human chain ' to stop muslim men who were allegedly trying to throw them overboard . after the threats we found ourselves in open sea and not long after they started to throw some christians in the sea . â€™
