not fancying driving along twisting lanes , we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded water way restaurant at spartia beach . a sweeping view across the turquoise waters of lourdata bay and the white stands of lourdas beach . at the top of a flight of easy steps from lourdas beach , we found lorraine 's magic hill restaurant , with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband 's organic farm .
