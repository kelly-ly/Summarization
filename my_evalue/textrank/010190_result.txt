silence : representative darrell issa ( left ) asked the state department about the use of personal email for official business in december 2012 , but did n't receive any answer until clinton ( right ) had left the department . even her twitter profile picture was dragged into the row : it showed her on her blackberry apparently sending emails while en route to libya in september 2011 . clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account , calling it a matter of ' convenience ' , admitting to deleting thousands of emails .
