encounters with common dolphins off the west of scotland have more than doubled over a decade , according to experts . the shift north could be creating new opportunities for the common dolphins to find food in new areas , but may mean the species is competing for fish with other types of dolphin or seabirds . the charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel silurian to help conduct visual surveys , acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans - which include dolphins , whales and porpoises - as well as helping to run the yacht . areas that will be covered in the forthcoming survey depend on the weather but will range from mull of kintyre in the south , cape wrath in the north and st kilda in the west ( all marked on the map ) .
