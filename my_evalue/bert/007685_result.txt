gary teale has hit back at ronny deila’s criticism of the st mirren park pitch . after the parkhead club’s 2-0 win on friday night , deila branded most surfaces in the scottish premiership ‘terrible’ and argued that artificial pitches would make for better spectacles . celtic 's stefan johansen slots home his penalty to put his side 2-0 up against st mirren . it’s maybe a bit firm but it’s an excellent surface .
