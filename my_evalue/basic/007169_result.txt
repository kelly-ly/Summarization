there will be calls for england to get rid of alastair cook and jonathan trott on the back of their failures here but i think they should both play all three tests against west indies before any sort of decision is made . jonathan trott ( left ) and alastair cook head out to open england 's second innings against west indies . i said after the first day of this test that englandâ€™s top order was a bit one-paced which could be an issue but that does not mean i think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline .
