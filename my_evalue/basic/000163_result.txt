at the 30-mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code ( a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight ) . aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with sfra restrictions . as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the sfra airspace is already built into the system .
