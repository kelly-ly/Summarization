i 've moved like harlow in monte carlo , ' she sang , ' and showed 'em what i got… ' ( actually , when the song became a hit she was in straitened financial circumstances and working in a sweetshop in ilford , essex , so instead of moving like harlow she could have been singing about moving to harlow . ) i often wonder why greece does n't sort out its economic problems by selling off some prime mediterranean real estate - how many uninhabited islands does one country really need ? you will probably know kefalonia because this was the setting for louis de bernières 's novel captain corelli 's mandolin and , in direct contravention of usual hollywood policy , was where the movie was actually filmed .
