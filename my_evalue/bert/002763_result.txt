it will not worry andy murray one iota that his victory over tomas berdych on friday night may have lacked the drama or controversy that accompanied their australian open semi-final in january . that fact backs up the belief that he is returning to the kind of form last seen from him in the first half of 2013 , which led to him winning the wimbledon title . kim sears , who he is marrying next week , kept a much lower profile this time , hidden beneath the wide-peaked straw hat protecting her from the fierce florida sun . murray has played more matches on this crandon park court than any other outside wimbledonâ€™s centre court and the rod laver arena , and knows what to expect in conditions that are usually heavy and humid with a brisk breeze .
