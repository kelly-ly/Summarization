probably the most extraordinary thing about the island of st helena is that it was ever found at all . here , the runway of the future airport is visible . traveller liz gill describes the ship as a ' ship of two halves ' : the front laden with dozens of huge containers , with a sundeck out back . then there was the small but excellent museum , the forts , batteries and cannons dotted around the place , the fine collection of st helena prints and drawings at prince’s lodge ( in pre-photography days ships had their own artists on board ) , the boer cemetery ( 6,000 were imprisoned here during the boer war but given freedom to work , trade and organise events ) and the plantation house grounds to see jonathan the tortoise who is at least 182 years old and probably the world’s oldest reptile .
