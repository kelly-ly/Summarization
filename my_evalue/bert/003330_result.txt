last weekend , after a sunny day in the borders , i posted this picture of myself on twitter with the caption ‘ just met nicola sturgeon lookalike out canvassing ! ’ so what of the woman these people idolise as some great political saviour unlike any other figure in britain today ? when questioned on television this week , she refused to rule out a second referendum in the very near future . voters in england can do nothing to stop the sturgeon bandwagon gaining momentum — snp membership has tripled in the past year , and it’s now the third-largest political party in the uk .
