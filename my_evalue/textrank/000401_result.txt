so , here 's my question : are the two speedy responses from companies after women spoke out on social media more a sign that companies are truly getting it about gender stereotypes and girl and boy empowerment , or more a sign of the power of parents ? but she said these back-to-back incidents show what can happen when parents make it clear they wo n't buy products from companies that sell gender stereotypes . do you think more companies are getting the message to include girl characters on merchandise ?
