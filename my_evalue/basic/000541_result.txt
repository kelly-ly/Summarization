`` music is the most important tool we have in reaching these kids , '' said bernstein , 30 , a professional musician . i think part of the thing that really stuck with me was this feeling of wanting to belong to something , because i just did n't feel like i fit in with the other kids . when i started playing music it really gave me a sense of identity , something that i belonged to , something that i was good at , something that people would watch me do and say , `` oh wow , that 's really cool or he 's really good at that .
