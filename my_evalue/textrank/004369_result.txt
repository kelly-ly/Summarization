the dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional . the appearance is reminiscent of brooks popular adrenaline running shoes so friends did n't guess they were made by aldi until i told them . adidas shoes can often come up small , so it 's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size . in doing so , i found my pair to be a perfect fit .
