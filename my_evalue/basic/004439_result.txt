manchester united have fought all season to try to secure a return to the champions league , but six players shown the exit door at old trafford are in the competition 's final four . last season's disastrous campaign under david moyes saw united miss out on europe 's premier competition for the first time in 19 years , with patrice evra and javier hernandez members of the failing squad . but those two - plus cristiano ronaldo , carlos tevez , paul pogba and gerard pique - have all made the semi-finals in their former club 's absence from the competition .
