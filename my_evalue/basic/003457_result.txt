mark o'meara rolled back the years with one of the standout rounds of the day to make the cut at the masters for the first time in 10 years . the 1998 champion was one over after the first round but five birdies in his second , including three in four holes on the front nine , saw him card a 68 and ensure he will still be in the running at the weekend . the 58-year-old american is the third oldest man in the field in 2015 , behind tom watson ( 65 ) and ben crenshaw ( 63 ) , but showed excellent form to hit his first round in the 60s at augusta since 2001 .
