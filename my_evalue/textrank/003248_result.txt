wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream , and whipped cream or clotted , have been running for generations , with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century . the devon tradition is to slather the scone with cream first , while the cornish – who also lay claim to inventing cream teas – prepare their scones the opposite way . another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream .
