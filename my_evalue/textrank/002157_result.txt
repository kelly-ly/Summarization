teachers want children to have more play time to encourage greater communication and social skills . a resolution due to be put forward at the conference says : ' primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way . ' the resolution , set to be heard on saturday , also says : ' lunchtime and break times are being used for coaching and cramming sessions , thus depriving primary age children of their fundamental human right to play and have free time to socialise with their peers . ' the motion calls on the nut to support play for five to seven-year-olds ' to reflect the needs of the children ' .
