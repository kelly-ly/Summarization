it is the ultimate robin crusoe escape , a lonely house on its own island - just off the coast of cornwall . when the tide is in , the house in the sea is completely surrounded by waves , making for a peaceful retreat . for those wishing to use the island for celebrating , take advantage of the bar area , with 40 '' tv , bar billiards table and , most importantly , a fully equipped bar . there is even wifi for sending idyllic photographs of the island to friends stuck at home .
