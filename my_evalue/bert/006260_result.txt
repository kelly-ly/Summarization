tony blair yesterday faced accusations of ‘megalomania’ over an interview in which he vowed to set up his own ‘ leaders club’ of ex-statesmen – and appeared to dismiss the need for democracy . and i just know that if i do that , it would literally take me about three days before i was bored out of my mind . talking about the group of ex-leaders he hoped to deploy in his business , mr blair suggested that only those who had risen to the top of their countries could properly relate to each other .
