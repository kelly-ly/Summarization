burglars gutted a family home in what police have described as the worst case of ' mindless destruction ' they have ever witnessed . the intruders broke into a home in hatfield peverel , essex , flooded the kitchen , dumped the tv in a bath filled with water and slashed sofas and chairs in a wanton wrecking spree . the group even stopped for some toast - leaving bread and lumps of butter out on the sideboard . i am intent on catching those responsible for this burglary before they strike again .
