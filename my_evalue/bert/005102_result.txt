ian murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place hibs ' way ahead of rangers in the last month of the championship season . but while stuart mccall 's men have the momentum at present - beating hibs and cowdenbeath while alan stubbs ' men also lost to raith - murray would n't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards easter road before long . but the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down . we still have to go to queens and we 've got rangers and hibs at home so we 've got games that are meaningful for others .
