nico rosberg is too polite to say what precisely he finds irritating about the team-mate with whom he is locked in the battle of his career . while hamilton courts fame , rosberg’s dream evening finishes with him and wife , vivian , staying in to watch an ‘ educational documentary’ , their yellow labrador , bailey , at their side . i am not an ice man , either . hamilton said last year that rosberg was not as hungry as him because of their different backgrounds , the former being from a council estate in stevenage and the latter from a plutocrat’s playground .
