nasa has released the first close-up views of the north pole of dwarf planet ceres from the dawn spacecraft . dawn arrived on 6 march , the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet , and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission . ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter , with an average diameter of 590 miles ( 950km ) . dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid vesta in 2012 . the mission is so exciting , because we 're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system , ' dr marc rayman , dawn chief engineer and mission director at jpl told mailonline . ' for me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries , a mysterious world of rock and ice , perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds , lakes or oceans , is very exciting .
