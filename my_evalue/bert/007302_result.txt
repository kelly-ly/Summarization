from the moment jack johnson beat tommy burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908 , a frenzied search began . six years out of the ring had taken its toll on jeffries and in 1910 johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds , further enraging whites who rioted , taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate johnson 's win . he fled to canada and then to europe , fighting three times in paris , where he made history by beating ' battling ' jim johnson in the first-ever all-black heavyweight championship bout . i 've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when i say i that i beat johnson fair and square .
