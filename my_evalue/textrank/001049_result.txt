you see , chokalingam revealed that , as an undergraduate at the university of chicago , he engaged in a daring ( his view ) or ridiculous and offensive ( pretty much everyone else ) scam : he applied to medical school claiming to be african-american . this revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man , both to `` dramatically improve '' his chances of admission , and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools . to accomplish this goal , chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his `` long indian-american eyelashes , '' checked `` black '' under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname `` jojo . '' and now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired , he 's looking to write a book on his experiences , titled `` almost black : the true story of an indian american who got into medical school pretending to be an african american .
