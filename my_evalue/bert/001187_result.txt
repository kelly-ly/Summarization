teenager ben gibson had just seen his middlesbrough side knocked out in the champions league group stage when the email landed from club chairman – uncle steve – that he had been fired . the england under 21 star was a kid in the playground when his dad 's brother was splashing the cash on juninho , alen boksic and gaizka mendieta , before that there had been the likes of fabrizio ravanelli , emerson and paul gascoigne . it will have a bigger effect on the club and the town than winning the carling cup . ' and i think my uncle deserves it too .
