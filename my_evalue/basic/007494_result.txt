sunday 's trip to loftus road marks chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of roman abramovich , a period jose mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for english football as a whole . if the first 699 games under russian rule has established chelsea at the top of english and european football , mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the english national team as they implement abramovich’s demand to follow financial fair play ( ffp ) rules . in the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees , winning three premier leagues , four fa cups , three league cups , one europa league and one champions league , but now , mourinho says , abramovich’s rule will benefit england as well as chelsea .
