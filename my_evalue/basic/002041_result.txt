a leading hospital has slashed cases of a deadly infection that can kill newborn babies â€“ by defying national guidelines to offer all pregnant women a simple screening test . but a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at northwick park nhs hospital in north-west london resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested and subsequently treated with antibiotics . it concluded that not all women who test positive for gbs will go on to develop the infection or pass it on to their babies , so blanket screening would mean pregnant women would be unnecessarily given antibiotics , which carry their own risks to the foetus .
