england are in danger of losing their fourth champions league spot in the coming years , as poor performances from premier league clubs in europe take their toll . germany will begin next season with a higher ranking than england , once 2010/11 points are discounted . even if italian clubs fail to reach finals , a repeat of this season would see them overtake england in third place next season . with juventus in pole position to reach the semi-finals of the champions league , napoli all but into the last four of the europa league , and fiorentina in with a chance of joining them , italy are likely to out-score england by at least four points this season , and that margin would grow if all three italian clubs reach the final of their respective competitions .
