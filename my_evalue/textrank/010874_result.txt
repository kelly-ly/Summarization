kris wardle , who lives in leicester , thought his world was complete when he married his long-term girlfriend katrina in 2011 with her teenage son , mark , acting as best man . however , less than two years later , the hgv truck driver would be a widower , after his beloved wife was killed in a frenzied knife attack by now 21-year-old mark after a row over his cannabis use . he didn’t talk a lot , he’d come in , he’d do a bit of homework , he’d watch some tv , play computer games and sometimes we’d talk , but it would be inconsequential things , just little things , mainly about games . ' a couple of games he wanted to play , or the games he was looking to play . ' i think that him being as quiet as he was , made her so much more protective of him . ' as time went on , the couple grew concerned that the now 13-year-old mark was spending more time in his bedroom playing computer games and withdrawing not only from his friends , but his family too .
