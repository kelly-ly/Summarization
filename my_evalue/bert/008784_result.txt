luke shaw thought he had done ok as he walked off the old trafford pitch at half-time during manchester united’s fa cup tie against arsenal last month . last season he often spent time in mauricio pochettino’s office after training , sitting with the former southampton manager as they discussed different areas of their lives . with pochettino there was a real , almost paternal warmth to their relationship as the manager teased the best out of a player who went on to make his england debut at the age of 18 . he is a united player now , learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs in the world .
