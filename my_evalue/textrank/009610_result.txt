former juventus manager conte replaced cesare prandelli as italy boss in august after the azzurri 's world cup group-stage exit last summer , but his first seven months in charge of the national team have been topsy-turvy . conte , who guided the turin giants to three serie a titles before taking over as italy boss in august , was back at juventus stadium for tuesday night 's friendly with england and admitted the occasion had been emotional . ' graziano pelle 's first-half strike looked like being enough to earn italy victory , but andros townsend 's long-range effort 11 minutes from time secured england a share of the spoils .
