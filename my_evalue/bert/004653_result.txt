kell brook has finally landed the battle of britain he craved , but will take on frankie gavin rather than bitter rival amir khan . i respect frankie for stepping up , he has called for this fight for a long time . i feel like i 'm unbeatable right now and gavin isn’t going to be able to cope with my speed and power on fight night . the o2 is one of the best arenas in the world and it’s an honour to headline a card like this .
