esa’s rosetta spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet erupting from comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko . in the first image , taken at 7:13am bst ( 2:13am est ) on 12 march , the upper comet can be seen with several rays of dust illuminated by the sun , while the dark underside shows no such features . no one has ever witnessed the wake-up of a dust jet before . it is possible that the first rays of sunlight hit some cliffs or outcrops that remained hidden to rosetta due to the orbital position at the time , ’ said osiris scientist dr jean-baptiste vincent , also from the mps .
