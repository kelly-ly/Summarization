jeremy clarkson , james may and richard hammond today held talks with top gear executive producer andy wilman - just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the bbc . it means mr wilman , a childhood friend of clarkson who helped revamp top gear into the corporation 's most successful programme , is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel . the men were photographed today outside clarkson 's home in west london - their first public appearance together since the presenter was dropped from top gear - before moving on to a pub . earlier today , may ruled out returning to top gear without clarkson , insisting it would be ' lame ' with a new presenter in place of his sacked co-host .
