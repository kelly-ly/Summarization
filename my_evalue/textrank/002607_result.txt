david stockdale is unable to stop derbyshire 's near post effort after a good cross by jordan bowery . bowery blew a good opportunity for the home side when kirk broadfoot guided a pringle free-kick back across goal and into the striker 's path , but he headed well over under little pressure . at the right end , bowery dragged an effort just wide of the mark before a good interception from farrend rawson stopped best from getting in on goal .
