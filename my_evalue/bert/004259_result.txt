palmerston remains a very painful place for rangers managers . his side did have flickers of threat early on , but they often owed much to fortune . the winger was another change to mccallâ€™s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break , without making it amount to a great deal . play continues as a flare is let off in the rangers section of the crowd at palmerston park .
