wilfried zaha has admitted he felt ‘worthless’ during his two-year spell as a manchester united player after his dream move to old trafford turned sour . but the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at old trafford until the summer , by which time ferguson had retired and been replaced by david moyes . during a disastrous campaign for the club under moyes , zaha made just four united appearances before playing out the second half of last season at cardiff .
