we have had cereal cafes , a porridge pop-up and a toastie restaurant so it should come as no surprise that london is about to get yet another single-item menu eaterie . the fruit bowls include oshun native made with acaí pulp , banana and honey ; the oshun tang made with courgette , lime , sour cherries and acai pulp ; the oshun kong featuring acaí pulp , banana , lemongrass , ginger , coriander and honey ; and the oshun maya with acaí pulp , raw cacao , cinnamon , orange and avocado . liane holey , founder of the cafe said : ‘brazil’s streets are filled with vendors blending acaí pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl .
