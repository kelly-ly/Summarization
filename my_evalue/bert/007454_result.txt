frustration was clear in the voices of peter moores and alastair cook as they fended off repeated enquiries about kevin pietersen 's future more than a year after he had seemingly been banished from international cricket for good . the incoming ecb chairman has been responsible for the mixed messages that leave the england team in as big a state of turmoil and internal rebellion as ever . yet subsequently , most importantly in a phone conversation with pietersen , graves has done little to play down the 34-year-old 's chances â€” even if privately the chairman is said to be perplexed at the media 's ' spin ' on his apparent opening of the england door . since his pietersen outburst , graves has said that there will be an inquiry if england do not beat a ' mediocre ' west indies in the upcoming three-test series .
