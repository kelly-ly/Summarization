cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing shannon gabriel on for 76 . perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket , perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again , but cook has been searching for the ball far too early . his eyes lit up when he was bowled a short , wide one by shannon gabriel .
