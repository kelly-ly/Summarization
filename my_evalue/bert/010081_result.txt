my introduction to ferme de montagne did not take place at this boutique hotel’s enviable ski-in , ski-out location in the french resort of les gets – it happened at the bar at the dorchester in london . hosts such as rory are also trusted to ski with guests , make sure they don’t get lost , point out the rich variety of peaks – such as the magnificent dents du midi cluster from the top of fornet above avoriaz – and crucially , as far as this epicurean skier is concerned , recommend great on-mountain restaurants . the hotel offers the best of all ski holidays . food is central to a ski holiday at ferme de montagne as andrew , a repeat guest , summed up at dinner .
