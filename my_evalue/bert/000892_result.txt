( cnn ) hillary clinton finally answered the question we 've all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016 ? first , clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate , if there is such a thing . but men yelling `` iron my shirt '' at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing hillary clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know . and if she loses , it will be because the gop developed a winning message .
