eight years ago , after his ac milan team had beaten liverpool to win the champions league final in athens , kaka knelt in the centre circle , spread his arms out wide , tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication . please correct me if i 'm wrong but i ca n't remember anybody screaming that what kaka had done was a ' disgrace ' . i ca n't remember anyone saying that such shows of religious devotion were out of place at a football match .
