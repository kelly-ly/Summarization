the huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies . this means it can not regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy , therefore a longer wavelength , which corresponds to a colder temperature . the huge unexpected cold spot region , shown , contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe , and about 10,000 less galaxies .
