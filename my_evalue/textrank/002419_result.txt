wigan are better than this , and they know it . fulham striker ross mccormack lets fly with a shot to score his side 's opening goal against wigan on friday . caldwell , a rugged central defender , will be unhappy with the ease with which mccormack opened the scoring after just four minutes ; harry maguire 's header was a poor one , straight into the path of sean kavanagh , who fed the scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond scott carson .
