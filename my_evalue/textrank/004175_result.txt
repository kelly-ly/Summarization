but the notes also betray the vital importance for the labour leader of landing a blow on the prime minister – and contrasting himself with mr cameron . for example , after mr cameron reminded the labour leader of his alleged plan to ‘weaponise’ the nhs , mr miliband’s quickfire retort – ‘ i would say to everybody at home : use your vote as a weapon to fight for the future of the health service’ – was drawn virtually word for word from his notes . ‘ they also show how ed set out a positive vision for the future with labour’s better plan , including on zero-hours contracts , lower tuition fees and rents . ’ our surveys said : after four opinion polls were released , the average poll of polls put mr cameron narrowly ahead on 22 per cent , with 21.5 per cent saying mr miliband won , 21 per cent backing mr farage and 20 per cent favouring miss sturgeon .
