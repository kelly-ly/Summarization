this is the embarrassing moment a buckingham palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box . the queen 's guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular changing of the guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera . the moment it all started to go wrong : the guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . the ministry of defence said they would not comment on ' a young man falling over while doing his job ' .
