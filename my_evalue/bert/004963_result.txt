luke shaw admitted he has struggled to cope with the demands of playing for manchester united after he returned to the team against chelsea . the left back , who had a decent game on his return to the team at stamford bridge , said : ' i am still young and coming to the biggest club in the world has n't been easy for me . i would n't say it has been a hard three weeks but it has been a three weeks that i have been able to learn a lot more about myself , so it has been a nice three weeks in that respect and good to get on the pitch again . ' mauricio pochettino brought the best out of shaw at st mary 's last season , and there was a real sense of paternal warmth between manager and player .
