the magpies declined to comment , but aarons ' loss would be yet another blow to head coach john carver , who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five barclays premier league games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating . carver can not call on striker papiss cisse , who has three more games to serve of his suspension , while steven taylor , paul dummett , massadio haidara , cheick tiote , aarons and de jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign . newcastle had hoped aarons ' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks .
