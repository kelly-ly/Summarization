frank lampard’s role at manchester city was always planned as being just a bit part player – but maybe the 36-year-old should have started more games . in an era when yellow cards get dished out to defenders like confetti , phil jagielka is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking on club duty . the 32-year-old did get his name taken during england’s 3-1 win over slovenia in november , but the 1-0 win over burnley was his 46th appearance in all competitions for everton without getting into trouble despite being in the thick of the action , making 16 clearances .
