a british athlete has become the fastest man to run 16,300 miles around the world despite being attacked by bears , hunted by packs of wild dogs , and run over twice . mr carr was also the first man to complete the gruelling endurance run unsupported , and instead of a team carrying his equipment , he pushed it along himself in a buggy . mr carr pushes his buggy full of equipment , which weighed twice as much as him , through dunedin in new zealand during the middle of his adventure . i did n't have much time to lament on loneliness as i was concentrating on the traffic and where i was going to sleep that night and find a shop .
