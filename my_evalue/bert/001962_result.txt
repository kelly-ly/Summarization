esa’s rosetta spacecraft has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67p after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby . the spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles ( 400km ) of the comet to within 90 miles ( 140km ) by wednesday next week . rosetta was tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface ( shown in image ) . the latest images include ones of earth and mars which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘ gravity assist manoeuvres’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet .
