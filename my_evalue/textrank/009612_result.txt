it was albert adomah 's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area , but martinez did well to get down to it , and he was also denied by danny lafferty on the line minutes later . the opening goal came five minutes into the second half when tomlin pressed forward and the millers defenders stood off the forward , allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past martinez . the united keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for bamford , but martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet .
