fall river , massachusetts ( cnn ) former new england patriots star aaron hernandez looked on impassively wednesday as he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole , a new low for a young man who once enjoyed a $ 40 million pro-football contract and now stands convicted in the 2013 murder of onetime friend odin lloyd . the jurors said they learned about other pending cases against hernandez , including a pair of murder counts , after rendering their verdict . the prosecution portrayed hernandez as cold , calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention , one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others .
