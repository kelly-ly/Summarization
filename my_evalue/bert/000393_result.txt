( cnn ) it is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the hillary clinton camp prelaunch : how do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot ? same questions , no doubt , that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie barack obama , and same questions they asked when , as first lady , she ran for the senate in new york . not to mention famous , accomplished and controversial . maybe it 's that the old lessons of message discipline do n't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create â€” at least not with this candidate .
