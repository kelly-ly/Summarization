but can a woman with 34g curves like mine ever look fab in a strapless dress ? i would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than i am . the narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs , making me look taller and slimmer , and the bustline is quite high , hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look .
