this is the moment a driver deliberately blocked a sneaky motorist who tried to beat a traffic jam with an undertaking manoeuvre . traffic began to build up on the m58 around switch island in merseyside when a silver mercedes attempted to undertake the trafffic . the two cars then swerve around the lane as the renault stays determined in not letting the mercedes past . the mercedes , behind , is then forced to wait like the rest of the drivers , for 10 minutes as they approach an roundabout .
