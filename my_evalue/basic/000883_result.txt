luckily , katie -- a giraffe at the dallas zoo -- is a champ . in an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by animal planet , katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby ( about 6 feet tall ) early friday evening . but there were good signs , as seen on the live stream and dallas zoo 's twitter feed -- like its ears moving , its efforts to stand , and its nursing ( or at least trying to nurse ) from mom .
