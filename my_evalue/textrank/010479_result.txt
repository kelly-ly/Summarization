dr shearing and his colleagues subjected two commercial li-ion batteries , known as cell 1 and cell 2 , to external heat . cell 1 remained intact during battery failure and as the heat-generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the batteryâ€™s vent . as a safety measure , packs are fitted with dividers to protect failing cells from affecting nearby cells .
