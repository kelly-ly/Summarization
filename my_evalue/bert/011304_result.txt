sometimes life imitates art , but apparently not when it comes to the central intelligence agency . that 's not me : retired cia officer sandra grimes ( pictured above in january 2013 ) is one of many former and current women at the agency speaking out about depictions of female spies on tv and in movies . a retired covert officer identified as meredith says sex is n't a major part of the spy game . women donâ€™t think more intuitively than men , but we tend to trust our own gut less .
