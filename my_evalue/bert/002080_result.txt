kevin pietersen has thrown his support behind former team-mate michael vaughan as the right man to ' change the brand of cricket currently being played ' in england . ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 ashes , vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of england cricket , a streamlined version of the managing director 's job which was abolished with paul downton 's sacking on wednesday . vaughan holds the urn after england famously reclaimed the ashes against australia in 2005 . surrey chief alec stewart , another former england captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ecb , is a confirmed pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant , andrew strauss , is unlikely to be as effusive .
