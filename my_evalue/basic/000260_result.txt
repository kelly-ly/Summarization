the timing of the detentions of china 's most inventive women 's rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women 's achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women 's rights . this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential fourth world conference on women hosted in beijing , during which hillary clinton famously declared that `` women 's rights are human rights . '' as women 's rights activists , wu and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second-class citizens .
