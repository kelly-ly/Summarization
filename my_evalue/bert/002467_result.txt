steve cotterill could be just a week away from putting bristol city back into the championship . subs not used : barker , barthram , hylton , rodgers , cameron belford . ben gladwin ( left ) brings the ball for swindon as bristol city 's joe bryan ( centre ) gives chace in midfield . but williams , who had 21 of them , could n't quite find his shooting range and put another gilt edged opportunity over the bar just after half time when massimo luongo had sent him clear .
