millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that £85 was not an ' excessively high ' penalty for staying too long in a car park . mr beavis , from chelmsford , essex , had gone to court to fight what he called the ' bullying and threatening ' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces . the 48-year-old , who runs a fish and chip shop , got the £85 fine in april 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the riverside retail park in chelmsford .
