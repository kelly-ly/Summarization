i 've been very lucky to cover so many great games but i do usually plump for this same one , ' tyler reminisced with sky sports . ' liverpool 4 , newcastle 3 . ' everybody remembers newcastle going for [ the league title ] but liverpool were in the mix as well ; and maybe they looked too much at each other because neither of them won it in the end . ' despite sir alex ferguson 's manchester united finishing top of the pile at the end of the season , the game still firmly holds a place in tyler 's personal archive . robbie fowler ( second right ) rises above john beresford to head home the opener for liverpool .
