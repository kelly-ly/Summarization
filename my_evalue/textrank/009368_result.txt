brendan rodgers has criticised raheem sterling’s advisor , suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at liverpool if left to make a decision alone . the only thing i would say on raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially , liverpool football club is the best place for him . ‘ i think he enjoys being at liverpool and loves playing for liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of liverpool supporters .
