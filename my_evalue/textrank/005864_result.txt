here hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor vn1r in humans . ' these results constitute compelling evidence that a pheromone effect different from normal olfactory perception indeed exists in humans , ' says scent researcher prof hanns hatt from ruhr-universit√§t bochum in germany . hedione triggered brain areas in the limbic system , which is responsible for emotions , memory and motivation , more effectively than phenylethyl alcohol . mice have around 300 different genes for pheromone receptors ; in humans , probably only five of them are still functional . ' in the next stage , we want to find out which physiological and psychological parameters are affected when hedione activates the pheromone receptor , ' explains hanns hatt .
