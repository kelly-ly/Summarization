england must decide whether to stick with the attack that failed to force a first test win or twist and freshen things up for a second match that is already upon them . the sight of liam plunkett and mark wood impressing in the nets here on sunday , and moeen ali bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad , was a reminder that england have options for the second test which starts on tuesday . chris jordan was the fastest bowler in the first test , clocked at 91mph , and while it would be a huge surprise if england dropped either anderson or broad , there is a case for plunkett or the impressive wood to feature .
