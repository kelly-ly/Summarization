but 17-year-old siobhan o'dell hit back after being sent a rejection letter from duke university , by sending the admissions office a message of her own , rejecting their rejection . siobahn o'dell , 17 , from north carolina , sent this response to an email from the admissions department at duke university telling her she had missed out on a place . however , refusing to take no for an answer , she wrote back , saying : ' after careful consideration , i regret to inform you that i am unable to accept your refusal to offer me admission into the fall 2015 freshman class at duke . my only regret is not proof reading it first as a few people have pointed out the bad grammar . ' not sharing the joke : duke university did respond to miss o'dell 's email , but clearly did n't share her sense of humour , instead telling her she could appeal their decision , but was unlikely to get it overturned .
