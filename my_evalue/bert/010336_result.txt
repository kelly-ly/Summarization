the red planet might still have liquid water , suggests information collected by nasa 's curiosity rover . the ‘ hidden valley’ in gale crater on mars . when night falls , some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost , but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water , so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid . in september of the same year , the first scoop of soil analysed by curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight .
