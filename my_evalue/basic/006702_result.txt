staff at scooter 's coffee , in omaha , were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours , starting at 5pm on sunday , by an ' unknown third party ' who then took control of the picture feed . instead of the usual images of smoothies , coffees and cookies , the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on delta air lines and crayola 's pages after they were hacked . from 5pm sunday until almost the same time the next day , followers of the scooter 's facebook page were sent links such as this one , instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies .
