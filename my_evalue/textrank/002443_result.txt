utility companies , including thames water , discovered the fatberg when local residents and businesses on draycott avenue and walton street started to complain about the rancid smell coming from the sewer . stephen hunt , project manager for thames water said : ' the amount of fat we 've had to remove has been staggering . ' cheslea has done itself proud here - we see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes , which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through - but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a metre in diameter is mind-boggling . the original sewer has been so badly abused by fat being chucked down the plughole we 've had to opt for the time consuming and disruptive option of replacing many metres of pipe .
