the stray dog was hit by a car , clubbed in the head and left for dead in a ditch in washington state . the dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing . but the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity . i 'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery , ' said sara mellado , who learned about the dog 's plight on facebook and took the animal into her moses lake home .
