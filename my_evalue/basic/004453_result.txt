the militant unite union was facing embarrassment last night over claims it ‘sacked’ an activist for complaining about being hired on a zero-hours contract . mr reuby , a unite member for 42 years , claims he was sacked by the union after complaining that he and more than 100 colleagues were employed on a zero-hours basis , with no entitlement to sick pay or paid leave . ‘ unite has openly campaigned about the use of zero-hours contracts , which provide far fewer benefits such as holiday pay and pension , yet there is evidence in this case that tutors employed by unite and other colleges worked under zero-hours contracts .
