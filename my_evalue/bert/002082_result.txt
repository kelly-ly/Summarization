gary and phil neville , ryan giggs , nicky butt and paul scholes will no doubt partying hard on tuesday night after salford city clinched the evo-stik league first division north title , with the club gaining promotion on a very fitting 92 points . salford knew that a 1883 win would take the title race to the final game of the season but they were unable to get the better of warrington town - handing the trophy to their rivals . but recently the co-owners admitted that it was n't all plain sailing after former manager phil power was sacked in january , with phil conceding that were turning into something they had always said they would n't . with the football league just three more promotions away , salford 's fans and very famous owners can dream about that prospect .
