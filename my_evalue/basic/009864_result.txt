jack grealish has a message for premier league referees : you can keep telling me to pull my socks up but there 's no chance of me listening . and grealish says , due to superstition , that he 'll carry on that way after making his first premier league start on tuesday night . his first league start for the club came in the pulsating 3-3 draw against qpr on tuesday , but the republic of ireland under 21 international was glad to get it out of the way .
