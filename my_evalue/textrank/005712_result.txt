4 spieth is an occasional member of the ' money games ' organised by phil mickelson in practice rounds before tournaments . 8 he won two and a half points from his four matches at the ryder cup in gleneagles last year , losing to graeme mcdowell in the singles after being three up with nine holes to play . i did not break 70 last year even having a chance to win so to shoot some low scores and hear those roars is very special . ' to join the club that is the green jackets and to join masters history and put my name on that trophy and to have this jacket forever , it 's something that i ca n't fathom right now . '
