dutch darts duo michael van gerwen and raymond van barneveld 's current form could n't be further apart as they head into premier league darts ' ninth leg in manchester on thursday . van gerwen was sensational in dublin last thursday averaging over 108 and hitting seven 180s , as well as narrowly missing a nine-darter , but with the 10-man field being cut by two after thursday 's matches his compatriot could be leaving the tournament early . i gave it my all . but not only that he has worked for all the big teams and now he is jumping into a big task at man united .
