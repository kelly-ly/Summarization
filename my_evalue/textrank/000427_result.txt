shelling began to boom through the yemeni city of aden on thursday afternoon as we hurried back to board the boat that had brought us here from djibouti . but aden remains a city not fully in the hands either of houthi rebels or forces loyal to the ousted government of president abdu rabu mansour hadi . but given how far along they are into the operation , the expectation would have been -- especially given the aerial cover the saudis are providing for loyalist forces on the ground -- that the houthi forces would have been pushed further back .
