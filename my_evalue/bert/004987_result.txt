after the launch of the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus , several new owners complained that the slim aluminium phones bent out of shape after being placed in tight pockets . the material would make the next iphone 60 per cent harder than the iphone 6 , taiwan-based economic daily news reported . tests showed that the phone bent out of shape under 100lbs of pressure - the same as the samsung galaxy s6 edge . another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied .
