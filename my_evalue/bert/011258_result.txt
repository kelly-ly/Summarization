a transgender comedian is the latest real life model to star in a campaign for clothing label modcloth , in which she models a variety of her favorite feminine styles . it was through these images that rye caught the eye of the label 's executives , who were quick to contact her about starring as one of modcloth 's monthly fashion truth campaign stars , a group of individuals who help the brand to get across the message that fashion is for everyone , no matter what their size , shape or gender . breaking out : rye , who came out as a transgender when she was 27 , says that ' living an honest life ' is the most important thing to her . i love rockabilly-type stuff or circle skirts that have interesting prints on them .
