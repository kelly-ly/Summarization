janea cox said in a march 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to colorado , where medical marijuana is legal , in hopes of saving her life . cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help , but it was n't available in georgia . under the controlled substances act , marijuana is listed on schedule 1 , meaning it has `` no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse . '' to backers of reform , it presents a catch-22 : marijuana is restricted , in large part , because there is scant research to support medical uses , yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions .
