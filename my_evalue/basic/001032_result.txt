kabul , afghanistan ( cnn ) the flag is crude , handmade , but the message is clear -- allegiance to isis in afghanistan . a group of fighters in afghanistan agreed to be filmed by a cnn cameraman parading their isis flags in a valley not far to the south of kabul , the afghan capital . it is often said that rivalry between the nascent isis presence and the taliban , who remain the big guns in afghanistan , is fierce enough to mean the isis fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag .
