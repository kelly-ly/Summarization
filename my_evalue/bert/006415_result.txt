ben affleck is apologizing after it came to light that the academy award-winning actor and director asked that information be withheld from a pbs show about his family history . pbs meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network 's editorial standards . while i do n't like that the guy is an ancestor , i am happy that aspect of our country 's history is being talked about .
