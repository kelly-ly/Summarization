apparently what people want his agent to tell him is that he 's not particularly good , he 's too young to earn big money , and he should sign whatever contract liverpool offer him because he should be grateful just to even be there . it 's that liverpool , through rodgers , have repeatedly told the press and the fans that there would be no problem and sterling would sign the new deal . liverpool football club should be embarrassed by that offer to raheem sterling , a player who kept quiet last summer when he watched adam lallana , dejan lovren and balotelli all walk through the door and sign deals worth more than double what he was on .
