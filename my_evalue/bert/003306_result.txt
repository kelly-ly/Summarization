hsbc has apologised after a link on its official website directed visitors to a pornographic page . anyone trying to access the bank 's page for the young entrepreneur awards - which has since been shut down - was greeted by images of women posing naked or having sex . embarrassing : the porn site took over the young entrepreneurs wards page after they were scrapped in 2011 and the organisers allowed its registration to retire ( hong kong branch pictured ) .
