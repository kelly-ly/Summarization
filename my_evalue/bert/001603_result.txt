jack wilshere has moved a step closer to recovery from the serious ankle injury that has wrecked his season after completing 90 minutes for arsenal’s under 21 side . wilshere has been out of action since suffering the injury in the 2-1 home defeat by manchester united on november 22 but is finally nearing full fitness . he saw a free-kick 25 yards from goal deflected just over the crossbar early on and initiated a move later in the first-half that culminated in serge gnabry firing a snapshot on the turn that was saved the legs of stoke goalkeeper daniel gyollai . and he repeated the trick five minutes before the break , locating the same corner from pretty much the same position after latching on to diaby’s slide-rule pass .
