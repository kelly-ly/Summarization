( cnn ) a brutal raid on the garissa university college in kenya has left nearly 150 people dead -- including students -- and dozens more wounded . those fears -- combined with a request from somalia 's transitional government -- led ethiopian forces to enter somalia in december 2006 to remove the icu from power . and that move inflamed al-shabaab , which then attacked ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern somalia , according to a 2011 case study by rob wise , who was then with the counterterrorism program at the center for strategic and international studies .
