since it was revealed that andreas lubitz – the co-pilot who purposefully crashed germanwings flight 9525 , killing 150 people – had been treated for psychiatric illness , a debate has ensued over whether privacy laws regarding medical records should be less strict when it comes to professions that carry special responsibilities . there are two arguments for why lubitz 's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing lubitz 's depression to his employer . the findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in germany on a patient 's right to privacy , with chancellor angela merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law . many in germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege .
