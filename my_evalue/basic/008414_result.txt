trott , who looks sure to open with alastair cook in the first test against west indies in antigua on monday , fell for just two , top-edging an attempted pull against a st kitts side bolstered by england bowlers liam plunkett and mark wood . it follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his england team-mate jimmy anderson but trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in st kitts ahead of the main business next week . trott’s only rival for the opener slot , yorkshire’s adam lyth , was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but alastair cook and ian bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match .
