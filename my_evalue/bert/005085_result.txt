train conductor graham palmer is the first to admit his poetic works are n't shakespeare , but when they 're delivered over the tannoy his passengers certainly do n't seem to mind . i do n't do them for every announcement and i try to mix them up a bit . his poem 's are anything but serious but they do get his messages about safety and ticket policy across . if you 're buying a ticket , please have the right money , ' cos my tea 's going cold and it 's simply not funny .
