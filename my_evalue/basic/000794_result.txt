( cnn ) on october 31 , 2014 , the italian government announced the end of `` mare nostrum '' -- a naval mission that rescued would-be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the mediterranean to seek security and a new life in europe . mare nostrum , which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013 , was replaced by the more modest `` operation triton , '' under the auspices of the european union 's border agency , frontex . it argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are `` an unintended ' pull factor , ' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths .
