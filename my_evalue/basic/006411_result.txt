ben stokes starred with the ball on the first day of england 's warm-up match in st kitts , but it was the runs of alastair cook and jonathan trott that pleased him most . the quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session , though stokes still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10 . both men needed the comfort of big runs , cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the world cup and trott on his first england appearance since november 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety .
