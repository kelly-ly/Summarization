iraqi security forces discovered tunnels in february that they say could have led opposition fighters to a central government compound in the city . iraqi and allied forces have made inroads in recent weeks , beating back the group that calls itself the islamic state , which took over vast swaths of iraq and neighboring syria last year . that may be best illustrated by the case of mosul , iraq 's second largest city and the site of one of its biggest embarrassments when iraqi soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts as isis forces advanced last june .
