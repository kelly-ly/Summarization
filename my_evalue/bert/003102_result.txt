a make-up artist has applied her formidable skills to transform herself into a very seasonal figure - the easter bunny . the final result took three hours to achieve after maria simply googled pictures of bunnies , picking one she liked best and replicating the image on her face . with grey paint , black dots stippled over the top and finally details like whiskers , and the bow tie that is drawn from maria 's neck up to her chin , the look was complete . it takes me about three hours in total and i 'll stop every 20 minutes or so to take a picture of my progress .
