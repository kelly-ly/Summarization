the furious backlash against the uk’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare lord janner from the dock . mrs saunders fought back saying it is her job as the head of the crown prosecution service to make ‘ very difficult decisions’ which are not necessarily popular . further questions also emerged about the true state of lord janner’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the house of lords just a fortnight ago to extend his role . when asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called , he responded in a personally signed letter received on april 9 asking to continue in office .
