go big : rather than having lots of smaller tables , seat your guests on larger tables . also , money saving sites such as groupon actually offer entire wedding day packages occasionally . do hire a planner : most people steer clear of wedding planners to save on extra costs but , whilst it may seem counter-intuitive to pay for help , wedding planners have a good network of suppliers , know how much they should be paying for something and are n't afraid of bargaining .
