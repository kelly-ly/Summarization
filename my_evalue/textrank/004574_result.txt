the humanoid , known as ham , has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in hong kong this week . the head , designed by american robotics designer david hanson , is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios . it contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across ( there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre ) . using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way .
