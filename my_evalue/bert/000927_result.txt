london ( cnn ) the pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25-30 % of iraqi territory seized by isis . cnn : what does the map tell us about the coalition 's strategy ? there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the iraqi forces . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in nimrud and killing refugees in camps like yarmouk .
