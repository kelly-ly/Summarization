louis jordan , 37 , released a three-paragraph statement on monday in which he said he stayed inside his cabin to keep dry and avoid sun , wind , waves and sea spray during his ordeal . the man rescued from a disabled sailboat off the north carolina coast has responded to critics of his story by claiming that he avoided sunburn and blisters by staying in the vessel 's cabin and that he survived by rationing food and water . that meant i had to stay inside the boat as much as possible , therefore i did n't have a sunburn , or blisters , as if i were found clinging to an upside-down boat , ' jordan said . jordan was spotted by a german-flagged boat on thursday , more than two months after sailing out of a south carolina marina .
