it looks like something straight out of a hollywood movie , and on april 1st , most cynics may assume the research vessel flip is a poorly considered joke . the rv flip does not have its own engine and has to be towed to the location of scientific study , where it turns 90 degrees , leaving just 50 feet above the surface . the vessel uses a system of ballast tanks which fill with water to shift the centre of gravity in the vessel moving it to 90 degrees .
