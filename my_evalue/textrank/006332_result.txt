mummified remains of 28-year-old terézia hausmann ( above ) found in the 18th century crypt of the dominican church in vác , hungary , were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . the researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis , five of whom had suffered from multiple strains . the researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of tuberculosis bacteria known as lineage 4 , which still causes more than a million tb cases a year in europe and america . by analysing the dna from these bacteria , the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred .
