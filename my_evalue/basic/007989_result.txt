mccoy was presented the champion jockey trophy by ian wright - mccoy is an arsenal fanatic . so one last time , he rode a mount around the surrey track , racing the rest of the field and one of the red-and-blue trains that hurry along behind the tree line on the far side of the course , towards waterloo . it was like that when the rest of the jockeys who have trailed in his wake for so long formed an honour guard as he walked into the parade ring to be presented with the champion jockey trophy for the 20th consecutive time , by ian wright , one of mccoyâ€™s arsenal heroes .
