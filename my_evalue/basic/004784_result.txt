as the general election campaign turned to education yesterday , the prime minister also attacked labour yesterday for opposing the expansion of free schools – which are run by groups such as teachers , parents and charities and are outside of local authority control . the freedoms which have come with academy status have helped fasna schools to improve education for children in our own schools and also enabled us to work better together to raise standards in other schools . though shadow education secretary tristram hunt said that labour would not ‘ go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools’ , ed miliband has said labour would ‘ have a proper local authority framework for all schools’ .
