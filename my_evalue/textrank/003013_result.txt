as these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance , especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves , and this friction helps create long seismic waves , that oscillate much slower . as these so-called long waves travel over the ocean floor ( stock image ) and continental shelves they create seismic waves that oscillate much slower . as these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance , especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves , and this helps create long seismic waves that oscillate much slower .
