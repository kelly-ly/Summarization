niki lauda is fully expecting nico rosberg to turn ' nasty ' at some stage after accusing the german and team-mate lewis hamilton of being ' egocentric b******* ' . that backed up rosberg who had ferrari 's sebastian vettel closing in from behind , forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio , who responded by asking hamilton to increase his pace . these guys ... i call them egocentric b******* , and this is the only way to win a championship . for sure , when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts .
