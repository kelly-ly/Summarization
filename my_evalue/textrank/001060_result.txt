viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page during the season finale about mary magdalene . our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century . there is actually nothing in second century writers that says that jesus was married and clement of alexandria ( died 215 ad ) takes for granted that jesus was not married .
