the founder of poundland who grew up with the family motto ' if you do n't work you do n't eat ' has revealed how he gave his parents £25million when he sold the company – but still relies on pocket money from his wife . mr smith used part of his poundland profits to snap up hammer hill house , a sprawling mansion near bridgnorth , shropshire , 14 years ago . with more than 500 stores in the uk - more than double the number it had five years ago – poundland has gone from strength-to-strength , making mr smith a self-made millionaire . i love hearing they have spent the money on something like a new kitchen instead , ' he said .
