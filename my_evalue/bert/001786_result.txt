ethan czahor ( pictured ) has launched ‘clear’ which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer . mr czahor said that with clear a user’s tweets are analysed using ibm’s watson supercomputer and put through sentiment analysis to ensure they are taken in context . he also made jokes about overweight women which sparked criticism that he was the wrong man for the job . last year twitter made it easier to find such messages as its search option allows anyone to comb through every tweet ever published publicly .
