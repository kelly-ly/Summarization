there have been a few names bandied around and i think straussy [ andrew strauss ] was considered last time the role came up a year ago , but he didn’t particularly fancy it . stuart broad admits he was sorry to see paul downton leave his role in the ecb . he’d be the last person to make too much of a fuss about a hundred in a warm-up game but i’d back him to score big runs in this series — he looks refreshed and ready to go .
